The SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) -III\u2019s Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) was designed to measure the expansion rate of the universe. The central ideas of this earlier paper are the introduction of conformal Hamiltonian dynamics, where a dissipative (\u8017\u6563\u7684) term is added to the ODE found in HMC.

The article on the CSI effect demonstrates a statistical fallacy, which is the view that, once a statistically significant result has been found, that this retroactively (\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5730) removes all concerns about inferential uncertainty due to variation in the data. It was around this time that the predicament (\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u5904\u5883\uff0c\u7a98\u5883) of my existence struck me with a jolt (\u9707\u60ca\uff0c\u60ca\u8bb6) .

The protosteller (\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684) phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar (\u661f\u7684) evolution. The phase begins when a molecular cloud first collapses under the force of self-gravity. It ends when the protostar blows back the infalling gas and is revealed as an optically visible pre-main-sequence star, which later contracts to become a main sequence star. The Ph.D. process is exhausting, and some leave the field after the grad school grind, never again to publish in a scientific journal. Others, though, find it exhilarating (\u4ee4\u4eba\u632f\u594b\u7684) , and go on to highly productive careers. We begin by studying how interstellar clouds of gas and dust are transformed into the myriad (\u65e0\u6570\u7684) stars throughout the night sky. stellar nurseries (a child\u2019s room for a bady) are scenes of violent outbursts, interstellar shock waves, even actual collisions, as prestellar fragments grow in mass and compete for resources in a newborn cluster. nursery school: \u5e7c\u513f\u56ed a large mosaic of a billion bits of data stitched (\u7f1d\uff0c\u7f1d\u5408) together from hundreds of small images the loose matter comparising the surrounding nebulosity (\u661f\u4e91) . The infrared spectrum (\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31) at bottom was acquired by Europe\u2019s Herschel (\u8d6b\u6b47\u5c14) Space Observatory. We do not see this activity (billions of stars have been born, lived out their lives, and died since our Galaxy formed) when we gaze (\u51dd\u89c6) at the nighttime sky, because the time scales on which starts play out this cosmic (\u5b87\u5b99\u7684) drama are enormously long by human standards. The road from a gas cloud to a single, isolated star like the Sun is long and tortuous indeed! 2021.03.12 \u00b6 The real lesson learned from those academic hoaxes (\u9a97\u5c40) : a key part of getting a paper published in a scholarly journal is to be able to follow the conventions of the journal. virus hoax: \u75c5\u6bd2\u6076\u4f5c\u5267 2021.03.11 \u00b6 The daemon process is terminated automatically before the main program exits, to avoid leaving orphaned (\u5b64\u7acb\u7684) processes running. orphan asylum: \u5b64\u513f\u9662 2021.03.10 \u00b6 In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (\u5b88\u62a4\u8fdb\u7a0b) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process. It usually more useful to be able to spawn (\u4ea7\u5375\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4) a process with arguments to tell it what work to do. 2021.03.09 \u00b6 Facts matter. Fairness matters.

The market often is up for part of the day and down for others, so the intra-day variability may undermine (\u4ece\u6839\u57fa\u5904\u7834\u574f\uff1b\u6316\u2026\u7684\u5899\u89d2\uff1b\u9010\u6e10\u524a\u5f31\u3010\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u6743\u5a01\u7b49\u3011) what the paper is finding. the data is not provided, although the source is publicly available (and would probably take me a week to try to match up to what they purported (\u636e\u79f0\u7684\uff0c\u4f20\u8a00\u7684) to use). These claims are absolutely preposterous (\u8352\u5510\u7684\uff0c\u6781\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684) . 2020.11.14 \u00b6 Imagine a person traversing a finite curved path while walking their dog on a leash (\u7cfb\u72d7\u7684\u76ae\u5e26) , with the dog traversing a separate finite curved path. 2020.11.13 \u00b6 trapezoidal: \u68af\u5f62\u7684 This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal (\u516d\u89d2\u5f62\u7684) shape as it grows. 2020.11.12 \u00b6 Medically speaking, diabetes is not curable .

It can take a lot of work to untangle (\u6e05\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u5f00\u2026\u7ea0\u7ed3) exactly what went wrong. Original researchers do all the hard work, and \u201copen science\u201d critics are lazy parasites (\u98df\u5ba2\uff0c\u5bc4\u751f\u866b) . People often repress (\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f) painful experience, which years later may later reappear as memories or disguised (\u5047\u88c5\uff0c\u63a9\u9970) emotions. 2020.11.06 \u00b6 Both of these extensions confer (\u5546\u8ba8\uff0c\u6388\u4e88) improved convergence properties on the basic algorithm without a significant increase in computational cost. confer sth. on/upon sb.: \u6388\u4e88\uff0c\u9881\u53d1\uff08\u5956\u9879\u3001\u5b66\u4f4d\u3001\u8363\u8a89\u6216\u6743\u5229\uff09 confer with sb. on/about sth.: \u5546\u8ba8\uff0c\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u4ea4\u6362\u610f\u89c1 The extensions to multiple-view reconstructions necessitated the introduction of nonlinear optimization strategies. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. It should be possible for a class to inherit from as many others as necessary, with an adequate mechanism for disambiguating name clashes . No comparison frameworks are available, leading to an arduous selection of an appropriate variant for particular experimental conditions. Laser-range sensors were a cornerstone (\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u57fa\u7840) to the development of mapping and navigation in the past two decades. 2020.11.05 \u00b6 planar open curves aerial imagery: aerial photography, \u822a\u62cd Skim the text to grasp its main idea. 2020.11.04 \u00b6 it has some deeply wacky (\u4e56\u50fb\u7684\uff0c\u53e4\u602a\u7684) scenarios voter turnout the betting markets have Trump as a slight favorite in Florida, which I\u2019d attribute to bettors performing some sort of implicit averaging of current polls and the 2016 election results. there is some room for maneuver here. the Republican party controls the federal government and many state legislatures . 2020.11.03 \u00b6 Picking pennies in front of a steamroller (\u84b8\u6c7d\u538b\u8def\u673a) : A parable (\u6bd4\u55bb\uff0c\u5bd3\u8a00) comes to life. I stopped by the Jamaican beef patties place but they were closed. Has Stan jumped the shark ? A bracket or tournament (\u9526\u6807\u8d5b) bracket is a tree diagram that represents the series of games played during a knockout (\u6dd8\u6c70\u8d5b\u7684) tournament. 2020.11.02 \u00b6 Politics has taken on particular vitriol (\u5c16\u523b\u7684\u8bdd) in recent years. Commentators and political scientists have described the rising tide of polarization in terms of concepts such as tribalism (\u90e8\u843d\u5236) and negative partisanship (\u515a\u6d3e\u6027\uff0c\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1) . 2020.11.01 \u00b6 An idealistic picture of science views science as an orderly process where disinterested , objective experts look at crystal clear (\u5b8c\u5168\u900f\u660e\u7684\uff0c\u3010\u55bb\u3011\u6781\u5176\u660e\u767d\uff0c\u5341\u5206\u6e05\u695a) evidence to find the truth. crystal: \u6c34\u6676\uff0c\u6676\u4f53\uff1b\u6c34\u6676\u7684\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u7684 Fake facts in Covid-19 Science: Kentucky (\u80af\u5854\u57fa\u5dde) vs. Tennessee (\u7530\u7eb3\u897f\u5dde) 2020.10.31 \u00b6 A psychology professor whom I\u2019ve never met once wrote me a mini- manifesto (\u5ba3\u8a00) , disparaging my efforts as a critic. Bumblers (\u505a\u9519\u4e8b\u7684\u4eba) are the people who get up every morning and make mistakes, trying to find truth but mainly tripping over their own feet, occasionally getting it right but typically getting it wrong. I think this dualism is counterproductive (\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\u7684) . but it would be more evocative (\u5f15\u8d77\u2026\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\uff0c\u5524\u8d77\u2026\u611f\u60c5\u7684) to show a series of images showing graying hair.

A spaghetti (\u610f\u5927\u5229\u5f0f\u7ec6\u9762\u6761) plot is a line plot with many lines displayed together. see also 2020.10.30 \u00b6 Maine (\u7f05\u56e0\u5dde) and Nebraska (\u5185\u5e03\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u5dde) our model is a forecast of vote intentions , not of votes as counted. Now that it\u2019s 95%, the rubber meets the road . It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. It\u2019s not a Jenga , but neither is it a WW2 jeep . this model really needs a lot more scaffolding for us to fully trust it. 2020.10.29 \u00b6 Fractal Nature of Scientific Revolutions. The interim (\u4e34\u65f6\u7684\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u7684) Stan governing body stepped down and were replaced with a new board elected by the developer community. a feud (\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u4e89\u6267) that was made worse by a lack of sharing code. condensed matter (\u51dd\u805a\u6001) theory 2020.10.28 \u00b6 Here is a fitted model from the Bangladesh (\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd) analysis predicting whether a person with high- arsenic (\u7837, \u7812\u971c) drinking water will switch wells.

Humility needed in decision-making. 2020.10.27 \u00b6 I just don\u2019t buy into the premise (\u524d\u63d0) so it\u2019s hard for me to go further. I hate to buy into stereotypes (\u58a8\u5b88\u6210\u89c4) . Talmudic (\u5854\u6728\u5fb7\uff0c\u72b9\u592a\u6559\u5b97\u6559\u6587\u732e) argument about whether God can dig a ditch (\u6c9f\u6e20) so width he can\u2019t jump across it. the question sounds snarky , but it\u2019s not meant in that vein . we must avoid the trap of overconfidence in our inferential summaries. the 40% rule is a time-tried tactic employed by pundits (\u67d0\u4e00\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u6743\u5a01\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6) making forecasts. 2020.10.26 \u00b6 There we mention that the birthday data come from the National Vital (\u6781\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684) Statistics natality (\u51fa\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u7387) data. I came across this interview of John Conway and Siobhan Roberts , Conway\u2019s biographer. I felt that there was a strong sense of competitiveness and ego in the maths world. Did you get a sense of a lot of people trying to outdo (\u80dc\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e) each other in the field? there are occasional examples of it coming to the fore more prominently . there were characters I encountered, Stephen Wolfram for one, for whom I think there was a bit of an unacknowledged competitive tension with John. The idea of competing with them is absurd (\u8352\u5510\u53ef\u7b11\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684) . That\u2019s a very egotistical (\u81ea\u8d1f\u7684) statement. egotism: \u81ea\u8d1f Conway doesn\u2019t mess around . Wolfram may be egotistical, but he has a lot to be egotistical about. if anyone can do that astounding (\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684) feat (\u6280\u827a\u8868\u6f14\uff0c\u529f\u7ee9\uff0c\u58ee\u4e3e) , it\u2019s this guy. Every once in awhile (\u5076\u5c14\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6) , though, Wolfram will break down and, with very great reluctance, talk about himself. that is somewhat reminiscent (\u4f7f\u56de\u5fc6\u8d77\uff0c\u56de\u5fc6\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\uff0c\u6000\u65e7\u7684) of time travel. 2020.10.25 \u00b6 I don\u2019t know that I could quite articulate what the rules are, but I can tell what\u2019s going on. The moral economy (\u9053\u5fb7\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e) of science. I heard a rumor that they have contacts at the Antarctic Polar Station who are going to sign the thing once they can get their damn fur gloves off. I\u2019ve obscured (v. \u4f7f\u6a21\u7cca) the details of the letter here because I don\u2019t want to single out the authors of this particular paper or the editor of this particular journal. 2020.10.24 \u00b6 its results are used to inform federal funding decisions. what are the effects of X on election, where X is ballot (\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u9009\u4e3e) -order effects, Fox News, home-state advantage, or other things? I agree with my correspondent that this graph does not look like a very good advertisement for this method! Never underestimate the power of fomo . 2020.10.23 \u00b6 This particular code is kinda hacky in that it does not account for fencepost errors, but it conveys the general idea. The premise (\u524d\u63d0) of this joke is that if the one economist had truly wanted the car then he would have walked into the showroom and bought it. Donating was used to determine whether men or women are better tippers . Donating was used to determine which prominent skeptic to prank (\u6076\u4f5c\u5267) . 2020.10.22 \u00b6 I was looking at this map of coronavirus cases, pondering (\u6df1\u601d\uff0c\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651) the large swaths (\u6761\u5e26) with seemingly no cases. Or, even worse, designing a study, not finding the anticipated main effect, and then using the interactions to bail you out . I\u2019m pretty sure the idea has been reinvented a zillion other times before and after I did it. Any sufficiently crappy research is indistinguishable from fraud. the notorious study in which participants were invited to stick 51 pins into a voodoo doll representing their spouses . it was just done by some bigshot professor who calls himself a \u201c myth buster \u201d. That voodoo (\u5deb\u672f) study is hilarious (\u5341\u5206\u6709\u8da3\u7684\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u6ed1\u7a3d\u7684) , worth a good rant (\u6012\u543c\uff1b\u53eb\u558a\uff1b\u5927\u58f0\u8d23\u9a82) or two. 2020.10.21 \u00b6 Kennedy looms large in retrospect but it is not clear that he was considered as a savior when he was running for president. There was the radicalism (\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e3b\u4e49) of the post-1974 reform movement, the 1994 Newt Gingrich revolution (\u7ebd\u7279\u00b7\u91d1\u91cc\u5947\u9886\u5bfc\u7684 \u5171\u548c\u515a\u9769\u547d ) , and then the locked-in partisanship of congressional Republicans since 2010, all of these which can be considered both as responses to executive overreach (\u8fc7\u706b\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f38\u5f20\uff0c\u505a\u4e8b\u8fc7\u5934) by opposition presidents and which have motivated counterreactions (\u9006\u53cd\u5e94) . 2020.10.20 \u00b6 a return to problem solving and dialing down of tension. characterize the modern presidents in this way, saviors: Trump, Obama, Clinton, Reagan (\u91cc\u6839) , Roosevelt (\u7f57\u65af\u798f) Carter (\u5361\u7279) in retrospect does not have a savior vibe , but he was elected as a transformative outlier. 2020.10.19 \u00b6 I\u2019d assumed that there are more pro Dem pollsters than pro Rep or unbiased pollsters. our model judges that to be a fluke someone sent me this collage (\u62fc\u8d34\u753b) of maps from Nate\u2019s model they\u2019re not just some sort of computer glitch (\u5c0f\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5c0f\u6bdb\u75c5) problem of the between-state correlations in the Fivethirtyeight ( \u4e2d\u6587\u89e3\u91ca ) election forecast. 2020.10.18 \u00b6 this might be a feather in the wind to prevent a predictable post-voting-day wrangle (\u4e89\u5435) that could tip the country over the edge . accusations of fraud seem almost inevitable. they can analyze precinct-level totals to look for \u201cthumbprints\u201d of voter fraud. it\u2019s not as sure as a photograph of \u201cmislaid\u201d ballots dumped behind a post office. 2020.10.17 \u00b6 I wan intrigued (\u6fc0\u8d77\u2026\u7684\u597d\u5947\u5fc3) by the observations you made this summer.

Spencer\u2019s idiosyncratic drawing of a large fairy on a tiny water-lily leaf captures an imagination that strained against conventional rules of composition from the start. a fact that helps explain how it manages to be both profligate and stingy, and is forever in the red. The concert was rather an amateurish affair. Only when we deal with these problems successfully can we benefit the most from university amalgamation (\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u6df7\u5408) .

And the campaign really got rancorous when Goldsmith tried to link Khan and extremists. Such counter-currents will prevent Kentish Town from gentrifying fully, suggests Gillian Tindall, a local historian. Interpreters are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos. Right, and that suggests the qualities that are most germane to the job. The fortress by King Philip Augustus was situated on the right bank of the Seine, overlooking\u2013 at that time\u2013 splendid bucolic scenery.

It was around this time that the predicament (\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u5904\u5883\uff0c\u7a98\u5883) of my existence struck me with a jolt (\u9707\u60ca\uff0c\u60ca\u8bb6) .

Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence classification parity , meaning that common measures of predictive performance One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. A team of researchers inside Pfizer (\u8f89\u745e\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5236\u836f\u516c\u53f8) made a startling find in 2015: The company\u2019s blockbuster (\u91cd\u78c5\u70b8\u5f39\uff0c\u4e86\u4e0d\u8d77\u7684\u4eba\u6216\u4e8b) rheumatoid (\u98ce\u6e7f\u75c5\u7684\uff0c\u7c7b\u98ce\u6e7f\u75c5\u7684) arthritis (\u5173\u8282\u708e) therapy Enbrel (\u6069\u5229\uff0c\u6ce8\u5c04\u7528\u4f9d\u90a3\u897f\u666e\uff0cEtanercept) , a powerful anti-inflammatory (\u6297\u708e\u7684) drug, appeared to reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 64 percent. A synopsis of its statistical findings prepared for outside publication, it says, did not meet its \u201crigorous scientific standards.\u201d Pfizer said it opted against publication of its data because of its doubts about the results. One reason for caution: another class of anti-inflammatory therapies, called non-steroidal (\u975e\u7c7b\u56fa\u9187\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269) anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), showed no effect against mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s in several clinical trials a decade ago. - steroid: \u7c7b\u56fa\u9187\uff0c\u3010\u751f\u5316\u3011\u753e\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269 I bet this revelation (\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u88ab\u63ed\u9732\u7684\u771f\u76f8) leads to a slew of off-label prescriptions, just as happened with estrogen (\u96cc\u6027\u6fc0\u7d20) a couple of decades ago. My physician friends told me then that you could not recruit subjects for a clinical trial because doctors were just prescribing estrogen for all menopausal women, to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s. Novartis political ideology: \u653f\u6cbb\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001 if you push hard you can find the weak points and magnify them until you get ridiculous (\u8352\u8c2c\u7684) inferences. but the way probability works is that you can always find some chink in the model and exploit it to result in a clearly bad prediction. I think the proclivity of Bayesian inferences to tend toward the ridiculous is just fine But Bayesian inference can lead us astray , and we\u2019re better statisticians if we realize that. I\u2019m exhausted by the ideology of the Bayes- evangelists . Would Republicans pay a price if they vote to impeach the president? Nixon loyalists paid the price\u2014not Republicans who voted to impeach.

It\u2019s great if you\u2019ve got hair to comb (\u68b3\u5b50) , but otherwise it leaves you looking a bit silly. Once my sister had the hiccups and my dad snuck up behind her and scared her. The hiccups went away but my sister made my dad promise never to scare her again like that.

Firstly, I need to install l2tp following the instruction of Setup L2TP over IPsec VPN client on Ubuntu 18.04 using GNOME . Sometimes it can be connected, but quickly disconnected. Then I tried to figure out the reason, such as specifying the phase algorithm, and I known a little about the difference of strongswan between libreswan from L2TP VPN on Ubuntu 18.04 client 3DES, modp1024, modp1536 and SHA1 are considered weak by strongswan and newer versions of libreswan, so aren 't in their default proposals (although some late versions of libreswan still allow modp1536 and SHA1 with IPsec IKEv1). You can explicitly specify the proposals for phase 1 and 2 in the IPsec config dialog box. You could try the following with strongswan : Phase1: aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-modp2048,aes128-sha1-modp1536! Phase 2 : aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1! Or for libreswan try: Phase1: aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-modp2048,aes128-sha1-modp1536 Phase 2 : aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1 Note the exclamation mark (!) with strongswan that isn' t used with libreswan. If you are not sure if you are using libreswan or strongswan, run : ipsec --version And when I click the option of Use this connection only for resources on its network seems can visit the websites of school. But neither with nor without this option, I cannot visit Google. And I found a question has quite similar problem with me, then I tried to learn and edit the routing table. \u7b2c\u516b\u7ae0\u3001\u8def\u7531\u89c0\u5ff5\u8207\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8a2d\u5b9a helps me a lot on the understanding of routing. But it seems that I don\u2019t miss the rule pointed out by the question. And so it might be due to the routing table. As a result, I give up and continue to use the reverse SSH to visit google.

Firstly, I need to install l2tp following the instruction of Setup L2TP over IPsec VPN client on Ubuntu 18.04 using GNOME . Sometimes it can be connected, but quickly disconnected. Then I tried to figure out the reason, such as specifying the phase algorithm, and I known a little about the difference of strongswan between libreswan from L2TP VPN on Ubuntu 18.04 client 3DES, modp1024, modp1536 and SHA1 are considered weak by strongswan and newer versions of libreswan, so aren 't in their default proposals (although some late versions of libreswan still allow modp1536 and SHA1 with IPsec IKEv1). You can explicitly specify the proposals for phase 1 and 2 in the IPsec config dialog box. You could try the following with strongswan : Phase1: aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-modp2048,aes128-sha1-modp1536! Phase 2 : aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1! Or for libreswan try: Phase1: aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-modp2048,aes128-sha1-modp1536 Phase 2 : aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1 Note the exclamation mark (!) with strongswan that isn' t used with libreswan. If you are not sure if you are using libreswan or strongswan, run : ipsec --version And when I click the option of Use this connection only for resources on its network seems can visit the websites of school. But neither with nor without this option, I cannot visit Google. And I found a question has quite similar problem with me, then I tried to learn and edit the routing table. \u7b2c\u516b\u7ae0\u3001\u8def\u7531\u89c0\u5ff5\u8207\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8a2d\u5b9a helps me a lot on the understanding of routing. But it seems that I don\u2019t miss the rule pointed out by the question. And so it might be due to the routing table.

However, I note that the version has been updated, although it is still for Ubuntu 18.04, not Ubuntu 16.04. Same results with the previous try, cannot start it after installing it, and no error thrown in the install procedure. But today I went further, I found that after I type /opt/baidunetdisk/baidunetdisk it throws an error, This program requires version 3.3.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.6.1. Try to install latest version from protocolbuffers/protobuf , first time the latest one, 3.14, but it doesn\u2019t work and it require .so.9 , while v3.14 has a .so.22 , I also tried copy .so.22 to .so.9 , or make a soft link, doesn\u2019t work. The second time I install v3.3 , the .so.[NUM] still does not match, and hence doesn\u2019t work. The error is libmirprotobuf.so.3: undefined symbol: _ZNK6google8protobuf11MessageLite25InitializationErrorStringB5cxx11Ev and then I follow the instructions in Ubuntu: mir package sudo apt-get purge libprotobuf-lite9v5 sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-lite9v5 the first step throws the dependencies warnings, related to libqt5 , then I uninstall libqt5 . Unfortunately, many running programs then exit when the uninstalling procedure keeps going, and I found that I make a big mistake!! Now, maybe the best way is to update my system from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 to recover the broken system. Actually I have updated my old PC from 16.04 to 18.04, seems quite fluent. However, for this PC, there are many disappointing problem. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt autoremove it is necessary to modify /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades from never to lts , otherwise it cannot detect new release version. Then run sudo do -release-upgrade refer to \u5c06 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \u5347\u7ea7\u5230 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Due to previous HK Ubuntu mirror, the speed is quite slow, then the first thing I need to do is to replace the mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list with aliyun by sed operation via sudo sed -i \"s#http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux/ubuntu/#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/#\" sources.list \u540e\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u81f3\uff0c sudo sed -i \"s#ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux#archive.ubuntu.com#g\" sources.list Then go on. However, I mistook enter something in the middle, and stop the installation procedure, that is might be part of the reason why I met so many problems. Try to run do-release-upgrade again, but it said no new release version, and told me to upgrade the software in the current version. Actually it is Ubuntu 18.04 now, checking by lsb_release -a then I run sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade after the first run, I think I am OK.

However, I note that the version has been updated, although it is still for Ubuntu 18.04, not Ubuntu 16.04. Same results with the previous try, cannot start it after installing it, and no error thrown in the install procedure. But today I went further, I found that after I type /opt/baidunetdisk/baidunetdisk it throws an error, This program requires version 3.3.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.6.1. Try to install latest version from protocolbuffers/protobuf , first time the latest one, 3.14, but it doesn\u2019t work and it require .so.9 , while v3.14 has a .so.22 , I also tried copy .so.22 to .so.9 , or make a soft link, doesn\u2019t work. The second time I install v3.3 , the .so.[NUM] still does not match, and hence doesn\u2019t work. The error is libmirprotobuf.so.3: undefined symbol: _ZNK6google8protobuf11MessageLite25InitializationErrorStringB5cxx11Ev and then I follow the instructions in Ubuntu: mir package sudo apt-get purge libprotobuf-lite9v5 sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-lite9v5 the first step throws the dependencies warnings, related to libqt5 , then I uninstall libqt5 . Unfortunately, many running programs then exit when the uninstalling procedure keeps going, and I found that I make a big mistake!! Now, maybe the best way is to update my system from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 to recover the broken system. Actually I have updated my old PC from 16.04 to 18.04, seems quite fluent. However, for this PC, there are many disappointing problem. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt autoremove it is necessary to modify /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades from never to lts , otherwise it cannot detect new release version. Then run sudo do -release-upgrade refer to \u5c06 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \u5347\u7ea7\u5230 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Due to previous HK Ubuntu mirror, the speed is quite slow, then the first thing I need to do is to replace the mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list with aliyun by sed operation via sudo sed -i \"s#http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux/ubuntu/#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/#\" sources.list \u540e\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u81f3\uff0c sudo sed -i \"s#ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux#archive.ubuntu.com#g\" sources.list Then go on. However, I mistook enter something in the middle, and stop the installation procedure, that is might be part of the reason why I met so many problems. Try to run do-release-upgrade again, but it said no new release version, and told me to upgrade the software in the current version. Actually it is Ubuntu 18.04 now, checking by lsb_release -a then I run sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade after the first run, I think I am OK.

Here is a strategy to automatically login. Linux/Mac Windows In the command line, generate SSH key pair by running $ ssh-keygen -t rsa then copy the generated public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server (if no such file and folder, just create them). See for more details. If you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), just follow the steps for \u201cLinux/Mac\u201d. Take the PuTTY client as an example, you can use PuTTYgen to generate the ssh key pair. Here is a tutorial . Now, we can directly access the server via $ ssh USERNAME@chpc-login01.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk Tip For clients such as PuTTY on Windows, just type the username and host in the specific blanks. Moreover, you can always re-express a SSH command by typing each filed in the respective blank. Since the login node is not suggested/allowed to run your test jobs, it would be more convenient to login in the test node, sandbox . This can be done with consecutive ssh, $ ssh -t USERNAME@chpc-login01.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk ssh sandbox where -t aims to avoid the following warning Warning Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal. bypass the login node \u00b6 TL; DR If you cannot access the cluster due to the out-of-service login node or outside campus without VPN, you can still login the cluster with $ ssh -p PORT YOUR_USERNAME@MY_BRIDGE If you are interested, please contact me for PORT and MY_BRIDGE . Buy me a coffee if it is useful. Usually, only the login node is out of service, but the jobs on computing nodes would not be affected. So there is a way to bypass the unaccessible login node. It also works when you are outside campus without VPN. Briefly, we can construct a tunnel (bridge) from you laptop to the cluster server via a middle machine. If you want to use my established bridge (tunnel), the above \u201cTL; DR\u201d is enough, but you need to fulfill the following requirements. Requirements for Using My Bridge (Tunnel) You should have configured SSH key pair for passwordless login. And if you are using PuTTY, make sure your SSH key is in the standard OpenSSH format instead of PuTTY\u2019s style, otherwise it will throw the \u201cinvalid key\u201d error. You can convert PuTTY\u2019s format in PuTTYgen, see for more details. If you want to establish a tunnel by yourself, here are the detailed mechanism. Requirements for Self-established Tunnel You can access another middle machine which has a public or campus IP. Otherwise, you can try to use free tools like ngrok to generate a public ip for your local machine, see my notes on how to access the intranet from outside . Step 1: ssh to the middle machine from nodes except the login node of ITSC cluster, say sandbox , with the remote port forwarding option -R PORT:localhost:22 Step 2: ssh back to sandbox by specifying the port -p PORT Tip Sometimes ssh session might be disconnected if no further actions, so it would be necessary to replace ssh with autossh (see my notes) The sketch plot is as follows, It is necessary to check the status of the tunnel. If the connection is broken, such as the sandbox has rebooted, pop a message window to remind to re-establish the tunnel in time. The command to pop message is notify-send , and note that a successful command exits with 0, use the script to check the status of ssh connection, #!/bin/bash ssh -t $2 ssh -q -o BatchMode = yes $1 exit if [ $? ! = '0' ] ; then #echo \"broken connection\" notify-send -i /home/weiya/.local/share/icons/unlink-solid.svg \" $1 \" \"broken connection\" fi Create a regular job as follows, $ crontab -e 0 * * * * export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR = /run/user/ $( id -u ) ; for host in sandbox STAPC ROCKY ; do sh /home/weiya/github/techNotes/docs/Linux/check_ssh.sh $host ; done where export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) is necessary for notify-send to pop a window (refer to Notify-send doesn\u2019t work from crontab ) Custom Commands \u00b6 Some of the commands would be explained in the following sections. aliases # delete all jobs alias qdelall = 'qstat | while read -a ADDR; do if [[ ${ADDR[0]} == +([0-9]) ]]; then qdel ${ADDR[0]}; fi ; done' # list available cores alias sinfostat = 'sinfo -o \"%N %C\" -p stat -N' # list available gpu alias sinfogpu = 'sinfo -O PartitionName,NodeList,Gres:25,GresUsed:25 | sed -n \"1p;/gpu[^:]/p\"' # check disk quota alias myquota = 'for i in `whoami` Stat StatScratch; do lfs quota -gh $i /lustre; done' # list jobs sorted by priority alias sacctchpc = 'sacct -a -X --format=Priority,User%20,JobID,Account,AllocCPUS,AllocTRES,NNodes,NodeList,Submit,QOS | (sed -u 2q; sort -rn)' # list jobs sorted by priority (only involved stat) alias sacctstat = 'sacct -a -X --format=Priority,User%20,JobID,Account,AllocCPUS,AllocTRES,NNodes,NodeList,Submit,QOS | (sed -u 2q; sort -rn) | sed -n \"1,2p;/stat/p\"' functions #request specified nodes in interactive mode request_cn () { srun -p stat -q stat -w chpc-cn1 $1 --pty bash -i ; } request_gpu () { srun -p stat -q stat --gres = gpu:1 -w chpc-gpu01 $1 --pty bash -i ; } request_gpu_chpc () { srun -p chpc --gres = gpu:1 -w chpc-gpu $1 --pty bash -i ; } t () { tmux a -t $1 || tmux new -s $1 ; } Interactive Mode \u00b6 Strongly recommend the interactive mode when you debug your program or want to check the outputs of each step. qsub -I \u00b6 The simplest way is [ sXXXX@chpc-login01 ~ ] $ qsub -I If there are idle nodes, then you would be allocated to a node, and pay attention to the prompt, which indicates where you are. For example, sXXXX@chpc-login01 means you are on the chpc-login01 node. Sometimes you can be automatically brought into the target node, then you are done. But sometimes it just displays the node you are allocated, such as [ sXXXX@chpc-login01 ~ ] $ qsub -I ... salloc: Nodes chpc-cn011 are ready for job [ sXXXX@chpc-login01 ~ ] $ then you need to manually ssh into the target node [ sXXXX@chpc-login01 ~ ] $ ssh chpc-cn101 [ sXXXX@chpc-cn101 ~ ] $ srun -w \u00b6 Sometimes you might want to use a specified node, say you want to use GPU (DO NOT forget --gres=gpu:1 ), then you can specify your node via the option -w . Moreover, you\u2019d better specify the partition and QoS policy -p stat -q stat , which counts your quota of usage. The interactive command is specified via --pty bash -i . The complete command is [ sxxxxx@chpc-login01 ~ ] $ srun -p stat -q stat --gres = gpu:1 -w chpc-gpu010 --pty bash -i srun: job XXXXXX queued and waiting for resources srun: error: Lookup failed: Unknown host srun: job XXXXXX has been allocated resources [ sxxxxx@chpc-gpu010 ~ ] $ Upon you are allocated a node, you can do what you want just like on your own laptop. Submitting Multiple Jobs \u00b6 SLURM and PBS are two different cluster schedulers, and the common equivalent commands are as follows: # PBS qsub -l nodes = 2 :ppn = 16 -l mem = 8g -N jobname -m be -M notify@cuhk.edu.hk # Slurm sbatch -N 2 -c 16 --mem = 8g -J jobname --mail-type =[ BEGIN,END,FAIL,REQUEUE,ALL ] --mail-user = notify@cuhk.edu.hk Sometimes, we want to submit multiple jobs quickly, or perform parallel computing by dividing a heavy task into multiple small tasks. PBS \u00b6 Suppose there is a main program toy.jl , and I want to run it multiple times but with different parameters, which can be passed via the -v option. submit.sh toy.job toy.jl #!/bin/bash for number in 1 2 3 4 5 ; do for letter in a b c d e ; do qsub -v arg1 = $number ,arg2 = $letter toy.job done done #!/bin/bash cd $HOME /PROJECT_FOLDER julia toy.jl ${ arg1 } ${ arg2 } a , b = AGRS println ( \"a = $a , b = $b \" ) The submitting command is $ ./submit.sh and here is an example in my private projects. SLURM \u00b6 Suppose there is a main program run.jl , which runs in parallel with the number of cores np , and I also want to repeat the program for N times. To properly store the results, the index of repetition nrep for each job has been passed to the main program. The arguments for job file can be passed by the --export option. submit.sh toy.job run.jl #!/bin/bash if [ $# == 0 ] ; then cat <<HELP_USAGE $0 param1 param2 param1 number of repetitions param2 node label, can be stat or chpc param3 number of cores HELP_USAGE exit 0 fi resfolder = res_ $( date -Iseconds ) for i in $( seq 1 1 $1 ) ; do sbatch -N 1 -c $3 -p $2 --export = resfolder = ${ resfolder } ,nrep = ${ i } ,np = $3 toy.job done #!/bin/bash cd $HOME /PROJECT julia -p $np run.jl $nrep $resfolder using Distributed const jobs = RemoteChannel (() -> Channel { Tuple }( 32 )) const res = RemoteChannel (() -> Channel { Tuple }( 32 )) function make_jobs () end function do_work () end nrep , resfolder = ARGS @async make_jobs () where HELP_USAGE documents shell scripts\u2019 parameters. $1, $2, $3 denotes the 1st, 2nd, 3rd argument in the command line, and $0 is the script name. The following command runs with N = 100, np = 4 and on the stat partition, $ ./submit.sh 100 stat 4 which is adopted from my private project . Specify Nodes \u00b6 The nodes can be excluded with -x or --exclude , and it can be specified with -w . TL; DR According to the following experiments, my observation is that the exclusion seems only to perform on the granted resources instead of all nodes. If you want to allocate specified nodes, -w option should be used. srun # cannot exclude $ srun -x chpc-cn050 hostname chpc-cn050.rc.cuhk.edu.hk salloc # cannot exclude $ salloc -x chpc-cn050 -N1 salloc: Nodes chpc-cn050 are ready for job # cannot exclude $ salloc -x chpc-cn050 srun hostname salloc: Nodes chpc-cn050 are ready for job chpc-cn050.rc.cuhk.edu.hk # NB: exclude successfully $ salloc -w chpc-cn050 srun -x chpc-cn050 hostname salloc: Nodes chpc-cn050 are ready for job srun: error: Hostlist is empty! Can ' t run job. sbatch # cannot exclude $ sbatch << EOF > #!/bin/sh > #SBATCH -x chpc-cn050 > srun hostname > EOF Submitted batch job 246669 $ cat slurm-246669.out chpc-cn050.rc.cuhk.edu.hk # NB: exclude successfully $ sbatch << EOF > #!/bin/sh > #SBATCH -w chpc-cn050 > srun -x chpc-cn050 hostname > EOF Submitted batch job 246682 $ cat slurm-246682.out srun: error: Hostlist is empty! Can ' t run job. Observation: -x seems not to work in the allocation step, but it can exclude nodes from the allocated nodes. Back to the manual of -x option: Explicitly exclude certain nodes from the resources granted to the job. So the exclusion seems only to perform on the granted resources instead of all nodes. If you want to allocate specified nodes, -w option should be used. Exit Code \u00b6 As the official documentation said, a job\u2019s exit code (aka exit status, return code and completion code) is captured by Slurm and saved as part of the job record. For sbatch jobs, the exit code that is captured is the output of the batch script. Any non-zero exit code will be assumed to be a job failure and will result in a Job State of FAILED with a Reason of \u201cNonZeroExitCode\u201d. The exit code is an 8 bit unsigned number ranging between 0 and 255. When a signal was responsible for a job or step\u2019s termination, the signal number will be displayed after the exit code, delineated by a colon(:) We can check the exit code of particular jobs, sacct -a -X --format = Priority,User%20,JobID,Account,AllocCPUS,AllocTRES,NNodes,NodeList,Submit,QOS,STATE,ExitCode,DerivedExitCode e.g., where the first one is a toy example and kill by myself with kill -s 9 XX , so the right of : is signal 9 , and it exits with zero code the second one is the one shared by @fangda . It is exactly reversed, and I suspect that it might be due to other reasons. see also: 3.7.6 Signals and # http://www.bu.edu/tech/files/text/batchcode.txt Name Number ( SGI ) Number ( IBM ) SIGHUP 1 1 SIGINT 2 2 SIGQUIT 3 3 SIGILL 4 4 SIGTRAP 5 5 SIGABRT 6 6 SIGEMT 7 7 SIGFPE 8 8 SIGKILL 9 9 SIGBUS 10 10 SIGSEGV 11 11 SIGSYS 12 12 SIGPIPE 13 13 SIGALRM 14 14 SIGTERM 15 15 SIGUSR1 16 30 SIGUSR2 17 31 SIGPOLL 22 23 SIGIO 22 23 SIGVTALRM 28 34 SIGPROF 29 32 SIGXCPU 30 24 SIGXFSZ 31 25 SIGRTMIN 49 888 SIGRTMAX 64 999 Job Priority \u00b6 The submitted jobs are sorted by the calculated job priority in descending order. TL;DR You can check the priority of all submitted jobs (not only yours but also others), and then you can find where you are, and figure out when your job can start to run. $ sacct -a -X --format = Priority,User%20,JobID,Account,AllocCPUS,AllocTRES,NNodes,NodeList,Submit,QOS | ( sed -u 2q ; sort -rn ) The formula for job priority is given by Job_priority = site_factor + ( PriorityWeightAge ) * ( age_factor ) + ( PriorityWeightAssoc ) * ( assoc_factor ) + ( PriorityWeightFairshare ) * ( fair-share_factor ) + ( PriorityWeightJobSize ) * ( job_size_factor ) + ( PriorityWeightPartition ) * ( partition_factor ) + ( PriorityWeightQOS ) * ( QOS_factor ) + SUM ( TRES_weight_cpu * TRES_factor_cpu, TRES_weight_<type> * TRES_factor_<type>, ... ) - nice_factor we can find those weights $ scontrol show config | grep ^Priority PriorityParameters = ( null ) PrioritySiteFactorParameters = ( null ) PrioritySiteFactorPlugin = ( null ) PriorityDecayHalfLife = 7 -00:00:00 PriorityCalcPeriod = 00 :05:00 PriorityFavorSmall = No PriorityFlags = CALCULATE_RUNNING PriorityMaxAge = 7 -00:00:00 PriorityUsageResetPeriod = NONE PriorityType = priority/multifactor PriorityWeightAge = 0 PriorityWeightAssoc = 0 PriorityWeightFairShare = 100000 PriorityWeightJobSize = 0 PriorityWeightPartition = 0 PriorityWeightQOS = 0 PriorityWeightTRES = ( null ) only the PriorityWeightFairShare is nonzero, and this agrees with $ sprio -w JOBID PARTITION PRIORITY SITE FAIRSHARE Weights 1 100000 $ sprio -w -p stat JOBID PARTITION PRIORITY SITE FAIRSHARE Weights 1 100000 $ sprio -w -p chpc JOBID PARTITION PRIORITY SITE FAIRSHARE Weights 1 100000 then the formula would be simplified as Job_priority = site_factor + ( PriorityWeightFairshare ) * ( fair-share_factor ) + SUM ( TRES_weight_cpu * TRES_factor_cpu, TRES_weight_<type> * TRES_factor_<type>, ... ) - nice_factor where TRES_weight_<type> might be GPU, see the usage weight in the table , and a negative nice_factor can only be set by privileged users, Nice Factor Users can adjust the priority of their own jobs by setting the nice value on their jobs. Like the system nice, positive values negatively impact a job\u2019s priority and negative values increase a job\u2019s priority. Only privileged users can specify a negative value. The adjustment range is +/-2147483645. the fairshare can be obtained via sshare , and the calculated priority can be obtained via sprio . refer to Multifactor Priority Plugin Slurm priorities CPU/Memory Usage \u00b6 Check the CPU and memory usage of a specific job. The natural way is to use top on the node that run the job. After ssh into the corresponding node, get the map between job id and process id via $ scontrol listpids YOUR_JOB_ID Note that this only works with processes on the node on which scontrol is run, i.e., we cannot get the corresponding pid before ssh into the node. Then check the results of top and monitor the CPU/memory usage by the job given the pid. Or explicitly specify the pid via top -p PID_OF_JOB Alternatively, a more direct way is to use sstat command, which reports various status information, including CPU and memory, for running jobs. $ sstat --format = AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize -j JOBID AveCPU AvePages AveRSS AveVMSize MaxRSS MaxVMSize ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 00 :02.000 30 1828K 119820K 1828K 276808K Correspondingly, the result from top is PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME COMMAND 213435 XXX 20 0 119820 2388 1772 S 0 .0 0 .0 0 :00.27 bash where VIRT == AveVMSIZE . The detailed meaning can be found via man top , VIRT : Virtual Memory Size RES : Resident Memory Size %MEM : RES divided by total physical memory Disk Quota \u00b6 Sometimes, you might find that your job cannot continue to write out results, and you also cannot create a new file. It might imply that your quota reaches the limit, and here is a tip to \u201cincrease\u201d your quota without cleaning your files. TL;DR Tip to \u201cincrease\u201d your personal quota is to count the files as the shared department quota, so just change the group membership of your files, $ chgrp -R Stat SomeFolder Firstly, you can check your personal quota with $ lfs quota -gh your_user_id /lustre # 20GB by default from ITSC in /users/your_user_id and here is two shared quota\u2019s in the whole department, $ lfs quota -gh Stat /lustre # 30TB shared by Statistics Department in /lustre/project/Stat $ lfs quota -gh StatScratch /lustre # 10TB by default from ITSC in /lustre/scratch/Stat An interesting thing is that the quota is counted by the group membership of the file, so if your personal quota exceeds, you can change the group membership of some files, and then these files would count as the shared quota instead of your personal quota. To change the group membership recursively of a folder, $ chgrp -R Stat SomeFolder A partial Chinese description, \u5df2\u7ecf\u597d\u51e0\u6b21\u56e0\u4e3a disk quota \u8d85\u4e86\u4f7f\u5f97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06 home \u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6587\u4ef6\u79fb\u52a8\u5230 /lustre/project/Stat \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e quota \u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u3002 \u540e\u6765\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u539f\u6765 quota \u662f\u901a\u8fc7 group \u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e0a\u8ff0\u547d\u4ee4\u4e2d -g \u9009\u9879\u5373\u8868\u793a group\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4 your_user_id , Stat \u548c StatScratch \u90fd\u662f group \u540d\u5b57\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u662f\u4ece\u522b\u5904\u79fb\u52a8\u6765\u7684\uff0cgroup\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5728 /lustre/project/Stat \u4e2d\u65b0\u5efa\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u6216\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u624d\u7ee7\u627f Stat \u7684 group\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u662f\u6700\u5f00\u59cb\u5728 Stat \u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e0b\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u76ee\u5f55 MYFOLDER \u65f6\u901a\u8fc7 chmod g+s MYFOLDER \u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u3002 \u4e8e\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fbf\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u66f4\u6539 group\uff0c chgrp -R Stat SomeFolder \u5982\u679c\u60f3\u627e\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u6587\u4ef6 group \u4e3a sXXXX , \u53ef\u4ee5\u91c7\u7528 find . -group ` whoami ` Custom Module \u00b6 The cluster manages the software versions with module , and the default module file path is $ echo $MODULEPATH /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles:/etc/modulefiles which requires sudo privilege. A natural question is whether we can create custom (local) module file to switch the software which are installed by ourselves or have not been added into the modules. Here is an example. There is an installed R in /opt/share/R named 3.6.3-v2 , which does not have the modulefile, since the same version 3.6.3 is already used. But there are still differences between these two \u201csame\u201d versions, 3.6.3-v2 supports figures, such as \u201cjpeg\u201d, \u201cpng\u201d, \u201ctiff\u201d and \u201ccairo\u201d, while 3.6.3 not, ( 3 .6.3 ) > capabilities () jpeg png tiff tcltk X11 aqua FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE http/ftp sockets libxml fifo cledit iconv TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE NLS profmem cairo ICU long.double libcurl TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE ( 3 .6.3-v2 ) > capabilities () jpeg png tiff tcltk X11 aqua TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE http/ftp sockets libxml fifo cledit iconv TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE NLS profmem cairo ICU long.double libcurl TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE To use 3.6.3-v2 , we can create our custom modulefile ( ref ), # step 1: create a folder in your home directory ~ $ mkdir modules # step 2: preappend your module path to the ~/.bashrc file ~ $ echo \"export MODULEPATH= ${ MODULEPATH } : ${ HOME } /modules\" >> ~/.bashrc # step 3: copy the existing modulefile as a template # here I skip the directory, just use name `R3.6`, which can also differ from the existing `R/3.6` ~ $ cp /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles/R/3.6 modules/R3.6 # step 4: modify the path to the software (`modroot`) as follows /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles/R/3.6 ~/modules/R3.6 diff -u #%Module1.0##################################################################### ## proc ModulesHelp { } { global version modroot puts stderr \"R/3.6.3 - sets the Environment for R scripts v3.6.3 (gcc verion) Use 'module whatis [module-info name]' for more information\" } module-whatis \"The R Project for Statistical Computing R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

The driver version of the node is fixed, but fortunately it is downward compatible, i.e., a higher driver version also supports a lower CUDA version. We can check the driver version by $ nvidia-smi Sat Jun 26 10 :32:03 2021 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 450 .36.06 Driver Version: 450 .36.06 CUDA Version: 11 .0 | ... which implies that the highest supported CUDA version is 11.0. The available CUDA versions can be found as follows $ module avail cuda -------------- /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles --------------- cuda/10.1 cuda/10.2 cuda/11.0 cuda/11.3 ( default ) cuda/9.2 For the above node whose highest supported CUDA version is 11.0, the latest cuda/11.3 would be incompatible, but others are all OK. Now you can pick the proper tensorflow version according to the supported CUDA versions. Here is an official configuration table , which lists the compatible versions between tensorflow, python, CUDA, together with cuDNN. Finally, you can validate if the GPU is correctly supported by running $ python >>> import tensorflow as tf # 1.x >>> tf . test . is_gpu_available () # 2.x >>> tf . config . list_physical_devices ( 'GPU' ) What if you want to use the version that does not installed on the cluster, say cuda/10.0 ? We can install a local cuda and creat a custom module to call it. Following the instruction: Install Cuda without root $ wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux $ chmod +x cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux $ ./cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux then download cuDNN , but it requires to login. After extraction, copy the include and lib to the CUDA installation folder. Next, create the custom module file, and finally I can use $ cuda load cuda10.0 to use the local cuda.

Here is a strategy to automatically login. Linux/Mac Windows In the command line, generate SSH key pair by running $ ssh-keygen -t rsa then copy the generated public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server (if no such file and folder, just create them). See for more details. If you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), just follow the steps for \u201cLinux/Mac\u201d. Take the PuTTY client as an example, you can use PuTTYgen to generate the ssh key pair. Here is a tutorial . Now, we can directly access the server via $ ssh USERNAME@chpc-login01.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk Tip For clients such as PuTTY on Windows, just type the username and host in the specific blanks. Moreover, you can always re-express a SSH command by typing each filed in the respective blank. Since the login node is not suggested/allowed to run your test jobs, it would be more convenient to login in the test node, sandbox . This can be done with consecutive ssh, $ ssh -t USERNAME@chpc-login01.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk ssh sandbox where -t aims to avoid the following warning Warning Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.","title":"passwordless"},{"location":"Linux/chpc/#bypass-the-login-node","text":"TL; DR If you cannot access the cluster due to the out-of-service login node or outside campus without VPN, you can still login the cluster with $ ssh -p PORT YOUR_USERNAME@MY_BRIDGE If you are interested, please contact me for PORT and MY_BRIDGE . Buy me a coffee if it is useful. Usually, only the login node is out of service, but the jobs on computing nodes would not be affected. So there is a way to bypass the unaccessible login node. It also works when you are outside campus without VPN. Briefly, we can construct a tunnel (bridge) from you laptop to the cluster server via a middle machine. If you want to use my established bridge (tunnel), the above \u201cTL; DR\u201d is enough, but you need to fulfill the following requirements. Requirements for Using My Bridge (Tunnel) You should have configured SSH key pair for passwordless login. And if you are using PuTTY, make sure your SSH key is in the standard OpenSSH format instead of PuTTY\u2019s style, otherwise it will throw the \u201cinvalid key\u201d error. You can convert PuTTY\u2019s format in PuTTYgen, see for more details. If you want to establish a tunnel by yourself, here are the detailed mechanism. Requirements for Self-established Tunnel You can access another middle machine which has a public or campus IP. Otherwise, you can try to use free tools like ngrok to generate a public ip for your local machine, see my notes on how to access the intranet from outside .

Then I got to know that there is another cpuset parameter which can specify a list of CPU cores to which a group has access. Then I tried to add such parameter to cgconfig.conf , cpuset { cpuset.cpus = \"1\" ; } and also update the corresponding cgrules.conf . Then I open an R session to run an expensive operation, > a = matrix ( rnorm ( 100000000 ), nrow = 10000 ) > replicate ( 100 , a %*% a ) and open another session with the same user. The target is to check if these two sessions are limited to a single core. However, each of them reach around 100% CPU. Tried to install PAM-cgroup as also mentioned in 4.3. PER-GROUP DIVISION OF CPU AND MEMORY RESOURCES \u2013 Procedure 4.4. Using a PAM module to move processes to cgroups but still not work. To validate if cpu and memory work, also run the same R script in the root session. According to cgrules.conf , the root session should be faster since it does not have additional restriction, but no differences. In the checking procedure, I learn to find the cgroup of a process, and no interactive shows, How to find out cgroup of a particular process? # systemctl status 3378 | grep CGroup # cat /proc/3378/cgroup list cgroup in top: press f , then select cgroup pure list cgroup as in top: systemd-cgtop check parameter, cgget -r cpuset.cpus interactive: 10.8 Displaying and Setting Subsystem Parameters Maybe I need to change another way, and I saw set-property in \u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3 Linux Cgroup \u7cfb\u5217\uff08\u4e00\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5 Then I tried to set the CPUQuota for user via (refer to systemd, per-user cpu and/or memory limits ) # mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d then write [ Slice ] CPUQuota = 20 % into cpu.conf , which means that the executed processes never get more than 20% CPU time on a single CPU (refer to 2.3. MODIFYING CONTROL GROUPS ), then # systemctl daemon-reload Repeat the above R script, the CPU percentage would be limited to 20%, not only regular user, but also root, since root is user-0 , such as # ls /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/user.slice cgroup.clone_children cgroup.procs notify_on_release tasks user-0.slice user-1002.slice but it would not affected jobs submitted via slurm, which has been validated. So this way would be quite good. SelectTypeParameters \u00b6 The default setting is SelectType = select /cons_tres SelectTypeParameters = CR_Core the configuration of computing node is NodeName = stapc051 CPUs = 96 Sockets = 2 CoresPerSocket = 24 ThreadsPerCore = 2 State = UNKNOWN With this setting, each job would automatically count 2 virtually CPUs, although we only request one CPU. After changing CR_Core to CR_CPU , each job would count 1 virtually CPU. However, the number of running jobs is still only 48, while the limits are GrpTRES=cpu=90 and MaxTRESPerUser=cpu=90 . My first guess is the scheduling system does not update on time, since if I count the completed jobs in sacct -a -X , the total number of cores coincidently equals to 90, then I tried to set a larger limit but not work. Ocassionally, I found how to unset the limit, use -1 , such as Resource Limits sacctmgr modify user bob set GrpTRES = cpu = -1,mem = -1,gres/gpu = -1 Notice that 48 is a special number, 96 / 2 = 48 , so my second guess is that each running job is still occupying a core, even though it indeed only counts a virtual CPU. Check the potential related configurations, TaskPlugin: change the default task/none to task/affinity , since there are some related materials, Support for Multi-core/Multi-thread Architectures , mentioned it. But not work. --hint=nomultithread : this is not a system configuration, but it can also cause only 48 jobs are running, then I have a better idea on the allocation on multi-thread machine, and here is an official example, EXAMPLE 9: CONSUMABLE RESOURCES ON MULTITHREADED NODE, ALLOCATING ONLY ONE THREAD PER CORE , and some examples in the mail list, Bug 4010 - Exploring Hyper-Threading CPU nodes Recheck the explanation of CR_CPU , here is one more sentence, The node\u2019s Boards, Sockets, CoresPerSocket and ThreadsPerCore may optionally be configured and result in job allocations which have improved locality; however doing so will prevent more than one job from being allocated on each core. I remembered the specification Sockets=2 CoresPerSocket=24 ThreadsPerCore=2 is required under the default CR_Core , otherwise it would throw errors. But according to this warning, it would prevent twos job from being allocated on one core. Then I tried to remove this specification, and then the number of running jobs is not only 48! Tip get pid of slurm job # scontrol listpids | grep 1261 then check the allow cpu list as in Bug 4010 - Exploring Hyper-Threading CPU nodes , before removing the specification, it shows # cat /proc/2636286/status | grep -i cpus_allowed_list Cpus_allowed_list: 0-95 but after working normally, # cat /proc/2636286/status | grep -i cpus_allowed_list Cpus_allowed_list: 43 so it can be an indicator to check whether the job is allocated normally. PrivateData \u00b6 Currently every user can view all users\u2019 job information via squeue . Set PrivateData = jobs in slurm.conf . And here are some other fields can be appended, such as usage , users , refer to slurm.conf - Slurm configuration file or man slurm.conf for more details. Diagnose Network Speed \u00b6 On 6/30/21 3:16 PM, found that the network speed on the new machine seems abnormal. I am downloading a file via wget , but the speed is quite slow, just ~500kb/s, while it can achieve ~4MB/s when I try to download it from our old server Then for complete comparisons, use the script curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python - to test the network speed (refer to How to check Internet Speed via Terminal? - Ask Ubuntu Also repeat the test on the new server to reduce random noise. The results show that both download and upload speed on the new server are much slower than the old group server and my personal laptop, ~90Mbit/s vs ~350Mbit/s.

Jun 27 11:10:27 stapcXXX.sta.cuhk.edu.hk systemd[1]: Started Control Group configuration service. here is an interesting finding. Different from other services, active (running) , it shows active (exited) , more details refer to the discussion systemctl status active: exited vs running . then write cgconfig.conf and cgrules.conf , and then tried to restart cgconfig , but it seems no idea to judge if the setting takes effects. Then I got to know that there is another cpuset parameter which can specify a list of CPU cores to which a group has access. Then I tried to add such parameter to cgconfig.conf , cpuset { cpuset.cpus = \"1\" ; } and also update the corresponding cgrules.conf . Then I open an R session to run an expensive operation, > a = matrix ( rnorm ( 100000000 ), nrow = 10000 ) > replicate ( 100 , a %*% a ) and open another session with the same user. The target is to check if these two sessions are limited to a single core. However, each of them reach around 100% CPU. Tried to install PAM-cgroup as also mentioned in 4.3. PER-GROUP DIVISION OF CPU AND MEMORY RESOURCES \u2013 Procedure 4.4. Using a PAM module to move processes to cgroups but still not work. To validate if cpu and memory work, also run the same R script in the root session. According to cgrules.conf , the root session should be faster since it does not have additional restriction, but no differences. In the checking procedure, I learn to find the cgroup of a process, and no interactive shows, How to find out cgroup of a particular process? # systemctl status 3378 | grep CGroup # cat /proc/3378/cgroup list cgroup in top: press f , then select cgroup pure list cgroup as in top: systemd-cgtop check parameter, cgget -r cpuset.cpus interactive: 10.8 Displaying and Setting Subsystem Parameters Maybe I need to change another way, and I saw set-property in \u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3 Linux Cgroup \u7cfb\u5217\uff08\u4e00\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5 Then I tried to set the CPUQuota for user via (refer to systemd, per-user cpu and/or memory limits ) # mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d then write [ Slice ] CPUQuota = 20 % into cpu.conf , which means that the executed processes never get more than 20% CPU time on a single CPU (refer to 2.3. MODIFYING CONTROL GROUPS ), then # systemctl daemon-reload Repeat the above R script, the CPU percentage would be limited to 20%, not only regular user, but also root, since root is user-0 , such as # ls /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/user.slice cgroup.clone_children cgroup.procs notify_on_release tasks user-0.slice user-1002.slice but it would not affected jobs submitted via slurm, which has been validated.

After changing CR_Core to CR_CPU , each job would count 1 virtually CPU. However, the number of running jobs is still only 48, while the limits are GrpTRES=cpu=90 and MaxTRESPerUser=cpu=90 . My first guess is the scheduling system does not update on time, since if I count the completed jobs in sacct -a -X , the total number of cores coincidently equals to 90, then I tried to set a larger limit but not work. Ocassionally, I found how to unset the limit, use -1 , such as Resource Limits sacctmgr modify user bob set GrpTRES = cpu = -1,mem = -1,gres/gpu = -1 Notice that 48 is a special number, 96 / 2 = 48 , so my second guess is that each running job is still occupying a core, even though it indeed only counts a virtual CPU. Check the potential related configurations, TaskPlugin: change the default task/none to task/affinity , since there are some related materials, Support for Multi-core/Multi-thread Architectures , mentioned it. But not work. --hint=nomultithread : this is not a system configuration, but it can also cause only 48 jobs are running, then I have a better idea on the allocation on multi-thread machine, and here is an official example, EXAMPLE 9: CONSUMABLE RESOURCES ON MULTITHREADED NODE, ALLOCATING ONLY ONE THREAD PER CORE , and some examples in the mail list, Bug 4010 - Exploring Hyper-Threading CPU nodes Recheck the explanation of CR_CPU , here is one more sentence, The node\u2019s Boards, Sockets, CoresPerSocket and ThreadsPerCore may optionally be configured and result in job allocations which have improved locality; however doing so will prevent more than one job from being allocated on each core. I remembered the specification Sockets=2 CoresPerSocket=24 ThreadsPerCore=2 is required under the default CR_Core , otherwise it would throw errors. But according to this warning, it would prevent twos job from being allocated on one core. Then I tried to remove this specification, and then the number of running jobs is not only 48! Tip get pid of slurm job # scontrol listpids | grep 1261 then check the allow cpu list as in Bug 4010 - Exploring Hyper-Threading CPU nodes , before removing the specification, it shows # cat /proc/2636286/status | grep -i cpus_allowed_list Cpus_allowed_list: 0-95 but after working normally, # cat /proc/2636286/status | grep -i cpus_allowed_list Cpus_allowed_list: 43 so it can be an indicator to check whether the job is allocated normally.","title":"SelectTypeParameters"},{"location":"Linux/rocky-server/#privatedata","text":"Currently every user can view all users\u2019 job information via squeue .

It is still possible to define custom functions such as scp_to_xxx or scp_from_xxx , but too many functions might be confusing and forget the detailed definitions. Maybe we can try to write a config file (refer to Configuring your favourite hosts in SSH ), in which we can define an alias for a hostname, and also specify the username, e.g., after defining Host XX Hostname REAL.HOSTNAME User weiya then I can just type ssh XX to access this server, and scp would also be much simpler, scp file XX:~/ . More importantly, we can use tab-complete when entering the path, which cannot be enabled by custom functions scp_to_xx .

Actually, it is quite easy, just to add the scope of the .tex file, which can be found by Editor: Log Cursor Scope . So I add text.tex.latex , but it would be annoying to highlighter the native latex command, such as \\newcommand , then I found that there is a Excluded Scopes in the config page of spell-check , so we only need to add the scope name of such native latex command, which again can be found by Editor: Log Cursor Scope if we put the cursor on the line of the commands. Finally, I add meta.preamble.latex, punctuation.definition.arguments.end.latex, support.function.general.tex, support.type.function.other.latex, storage.type.function.latex, markup.underline.link.https.hyperlink to the whitelist, each of which is identified by tries, such as cannot continue to add meta.group.braces.tex since the original text would also cannot be checked.

Based on this hint, I found the the corresponding shortcut in VScode, that is, Ctrl + Shift + . , refer to Go to next method shortcut in VSCode BaiduPan \u767e\u5ea6\u7f51\u76d8 \u00b6 \u53d1\u73b0\u767e\u5ea6\u7f51\u76d8\u51fa\u4e86 Linux \u7248\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728 Ubuntu 16.04 \u4f3c\u4e4e\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0d\u4e86\u2014\u2014\u80fd\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5b89\u88c5\u4f46\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6253\u5f00\u8fd0\u884c\u3002 \u76ee\u524d\u7248\u672c\u4e3a Linux\u7248 V2.0.2\uff08\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\uff1a2019-07-25\uff09 \u5b98\u7f51 \u663e\u793a\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u652f\u6301 \u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u4e2d\u6807\u9e92\u9e9f\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08\u5146\u82af\u7248\uff09 V7.0\u3001Ubuntu V18.04 \u4e8e\u662f\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002 bcloud \u00b6 \u9879\u76ee\u5730\u5740\uff1a https://github.com/XuShaohua/bcloud \u4f46\u662f\u56db\u4e94\u5e74\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u3002\u5b89\u88c5\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u767b\u5f55\u4e0d\u4e86\uff0c\u9042\u653e\u5f03\u3002 PanDownload \u00b6 https://www.baiduwp.com \u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u88c5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u8f93\u5165\u7f51\u76d8\u5206\u4eab\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7801\uff0c\u4fbf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\uff08\u800c\u767e\u5ea6\u7f51\u76d8\u672c\u8eab\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\u9700\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff09\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u901f\u5ea6\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u548b\u5730 bypy \u00b6 \u901b\u5230\u4e86\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5730\u5740\uff1a https://github.com/houtianze/bypy \u8fd8\u633a\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u524d\u6709\u66f4\u65b0\u3002 \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5728\u7f51\u76d8\u5185\u65b0\u5efa\u4e86 /apps/bypy \u6587\u4ef6\u5939\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u6b65\u8be5\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u5185\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u5916\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u6587\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e0b\u3002 \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u671f\u5f85\u5b98\u7f51\u672c\u8eab\u652f\u6301\u3002 \u5e38\u7528\u547d\u4ee4\uff1a bypy syncup bypy syncdown Chrome \u00b6 disable running in background \u00b6 To diagnose high memory usage, I found chrome is still running in background even if it has been closed, ~$ ps -e -o pid,cmd,%mem --sort = -%mem | grep google 13404 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 1 .9 13622 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 1 .3 632184 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 0 .7 13448 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 0 .6 13610 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 0 .6 1601941 /opt/google/chrome/chrome - 0 .4 ...

Refer to Which image viewer is able to show coordinates? Google Drive \u00b6 refer to Ubuntu 16.04 set up with google online account but no drive folder in nautilus Note that you should run gnome-control-center online-accounts in the command line, not to open the GUI. ImageMagick \u00b6 Perspective Transformation \u00b6 I usually take many photos when listening to the seminars, it is desirable to extract only the slides and discard the nuisance background. Direct cropping is not enough since the photos are not parallel to the screen. The solution is called perspective transformation, which can be done via -distort method , the usage is $ magick input.jpg -distort perspective 'U1,V1,X1,Y1 U2,V2,X2,Y2 U3,V3,X3,Y3 ... Un,Vn,Xn,Yn' output.jpg where U,V on the source image is mapped to X,Y on the destination image. The interesting area is the mapped sub region, and so we need to further crop them out, which can be done with -crop geometry , where the geometry is defined with WxH+x+y , which means the region of size WxH located at the xy-coordinates (x, y) , see more details in Anatomy of the Command-line Refer to the source code for more details.

An ideal solution would be simultaneously to lock the key via the same hotkey, as someone discussed in Synergy: Is there a way to push Win+L to all screens, not just the server? First of all, I become to use the custom behavior by defining some keystrokes via Configure Server -> Hotkeys -> New Hotkey -> New its associated Actions A complete instruction can be found in Add a keyboard shortcut to change to different screens Since Win+L fails on the client, try to define a new shortcut. Following the 4th method in How to Quickly Lock Screen In Windows 10 , Right Click -> New Shortcut -> C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation Then we can lock the screen after clicking this shortcut, but currently no associated hotkey. Right click to edit the properties, there is a shortcut key, which by default assumes the key starts with Ctrl + Alt , so just press the remaining key, say L . However, Ctrl + Alt + L does not work. Instead, Ctrl + Alt + 2 works. Then back to the host configuration. Bind the follow two keys, keystroke ( Control+Alt+l ) = keystroke ( Alt+Control+2,stapc220 ) then I can lock the screen of client via Ctrl+Alt+l . Since the above binding can specify the machine, I am thinking it might work if I bind Ctrl+Alt+l to Meta+l on the host. However, it failed, and it causes the screen of client cannot be locked. Anyway, the current solution seems already convinent.

I am considering if it is possible to set up a proxy for gmail separately. Then I found that setting proxy by PAC file might work inspired by Gmail imap/smtp domains to connect via proxy , since PAC file can customize the visited url. Then I need to learn how to write a PAC file , although later I directly export the rules written in SwitchyOmega to a PAC file. Once PAC is done, I need to write its location url, seems impossible to directly write a local path.

Then I found that when I run the ssh script to establish reverse tunnel, it reports that the address cannot be assigned, but actually it indeed works, then I realized that ssh would try to assign address for ipv4 and ipv6 simultaneously. It also reminds me a solution found several days ago, adding -4 for specifying ipv4. However, this method seems also not work.

An ideal solution would be simultaneously to lock the key via the same hotkey, as someone discussed in Synergy: Is there a way to push Win+L to all screens, not just the server? First of all, I become to use the custom behavior by defining some keystrokes via Configure Server -> Hotkeys -> New Hotkey -> New its associated Actions A complete instruction can be found in Add a keyboard shortcut to change to different screens Since Win+L fails on the client, try to define a new shortcut. Following the 4th method in How to Quickly Lock Screen In Windows 10 , Right Click -> New Shortcut -> C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation Then we can lock the screen after clicking this shortcut, but currently no associated hotkey. Right click to edit the properties, there is a shortcut key, which by default assumes the key starts with Ctrl + Alt , so just press the remaining key, say L . However, Ctrl + Alt + L does not work. Instead, Ctrl + Alt + 2 works. Then back to the host configuration.

Since the above binding can specify the machine, I am thinking it might work if I bind Ctrl+Alt+l to Meta+l on the host. However, it failed, and it causes the screen of client cannot be locked.

I am considering if it is possible to set up a proxy for gmail separately. Then I found that setting proxy by PAC file might work inspired by Gmail imap/smtp domains to connect via proxy , since PAC file can customize the visited url. Then I need to learn how to write a PAC file , although later I directly export the rules written in SwitchyOmega to a PAC file. Once PAC is done, I need to write its location url, seems impossible to directly write a local path.

An easy way is pdf2ps orig.pdf - | ps2pdf - flattened.pdf some alternatives can be found in is-there-a-way-to-flatten-a-pdf-image-from-the-command-line . rename \u00b6 Ubuntu 18.04 \u548c CentOS 7 \u4e2d\u7684 rename \u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\uff0c # Ubuntu 18.04 $ rename -V /usr/bin/rename using File::Rename version 0 .20 # CentOS 7 $ rename -V rename from util-linux 2 .23.2 \u7528\u6cd5\u4e5f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c sed \u683c\u5f0f\u8bed\u53e5\u8fdb\u884c\u66ff\u6362 rename -n 's/Sam3/Stm32/' *.nc\u3000\u3000/*\u786e\u8ba4\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6*/ rename -v 's/Sam3/Stm32/' *.nc\u3000\u3000/*\u6267\u884c\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u5217\u51fa\u5df2\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6*/ \u800c\u540e\u8005\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5f53\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u66ff\u6362\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u5373 rename Sam3 Stm32 *.nc \u53c2\u8003 Ubuntu\u4e2drename\u547d\u4ee4\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d Modifying replace string in xargs sed \u00b6 \u6253\u5370\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7b2c 10 \u884c\uff1a sed '10!d' file.txt , \u53c2\u8003 Get specific line from text file using just shell script \u6253\u5370\u884c\u8303\u56f4\uff0c sed -n '10,20p' file.txt \uff0c\u5219\u5355\u72ec\u6253\u5370\u7b2c 10 \u884c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531 sed -n '10p' file.txt \u7ed9\u51fa\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u53f7 ; \u5219\u4e0d\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u53ea\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\uff0c\u53c2\u8003 sed\u4e4b\u6253\u5370\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u884c \u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u5230\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u884c\uff1a sed -n '1,$p' \u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u548c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u884c\uff1a sed -n '1p;$p' , not sed -n '1;$p' \u5220\u9664\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u884c\uff1a sed -i '$ d' file.txt \u5728 vi \u4e2d\u6ce8\u91ca\u591a\u884c\uff1a\u6309\u4f4f v \u9009\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6309\u4f4f :s/^/#/g \u5373\u53ef\u6dfb\u52a0\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u53d6\u6d88\u6ce8\u91ca\u5219\u7528 :s/^#//g . \u53e6\u89c1 VI. print lines between two matching patterns ( ): /^pattern1/,/^pattern2/p , and if one want to just print once, use /^pattern1/,${p;/^pattern2/q} insertion (refer to and ) insert before the line of matched expression: sed '/expr/i something-to-insert' insert after the line: replace i with a insert multiple lines: add \\n in the text to insert, or add \\ at each end of line, see also insert at the beginning without new line: , sed -i '1s/^/<added text> /' file r : read a file and append it at the current point, sed '/EOF/r $thingToAdd' $fileToAddItTo , see also \u7ad6\u7ebf | \u5143\u5b57\u7b26\u662f\u5143\u5b57\u7b26\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u3002\u5982\u679c\u67d0\u884c\u5339\u914d\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u5c31\u5339\u914d\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002 directly replace hex string, such as 's/\\xee\\x81\\xab/\u5408/g' , see also Refer to Linux sed \u547d\u4ee4\u7528\u6cd5\u8be6\u89e3\uff1a\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u5668 sed & awk\u5e38\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f - \u83f2\u4e00\u6253 - \u535a\u5ba2\u56ed -r : \u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f \u00b6 \u53c2\u8003 Extended regexps - sed, a stream editor \u6458\u5f55\u5982\u4e0b The only difference between basic and extended regular expressions is in the behavior of a few characters: \u2018?\u2019, \u2018+\u2019, parentheses, and braces (\u2018{}\u2019). While basic regular expressions require these to be escaped if you want them to behave as special characters, when using extended regular expressions you must escape them if you want them to match a literal character. \u5c31\u662f\u8bf4 basic \u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u6b8a\u5b57\u7b26\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46 extended \u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u8f6c\u4e49\u540e\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u662f\u539f\u5b57\u7b26\u3002 \u4e3e\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50 abc? becomes abc\\? when using extended regular expressions. It matches the literal string \u2018abc?\u2019. c\\+ becomes c+ when using extended regular expressions. It matches one or more \u2018c\u2019s. a\\{3,\\} becomes a{3,} when using extended regular expressions. It matches three or more \u2018a\u2019s. \\(abc\\)\\{2,3\\} becomes (abc){2,3} when using extended regular expressions. It matches either abcabc or abcabcabc . \\(abc*\\)\\1 becomes (abc*)\\1 when using extended regular expressions. Backreferences must still be escaped when using extended regular expressions. single or double quotes \u00b6 When using double quotes, the string is first interpreted by the shell before being passed to sed . As a result, more backslashes are needed (see also my answer ) $ echo \"\\alpha\" | sed 's/\\\\alpha/\\\\beta/' \\b eta $ echo \"\\alpha\" | sed \"s/\\\\\\alpha/\\\\\\beta/\" \\b eta command expressions (also dollar expressions) would be evaluated firstly $ echo '`date`' | sed 's/`date`/`uptime`/' ` uptime ` $ echo '`date`' | sed \"s/`date`/`uptime`/\" ` date ` refer to single quote and double quotes in sed - Ask Ubuntu sendmail \u00b6 send mail on the command line.

The version on my T460p is 3.28.2, which can be seen from About. GNOME Shell \u00b6 GNOME Shell is the graphical shell of the GNOME desktop environment. It provides basic functions like launching applications, switching between windows and is also a widget engine. . User interface elements provided by GNOME Shell include the Panel at the top of the screen, the Activities Overview, and Message Tray at the bottom of the screen. The version on my T460p is $ gnome-shell --version GNOME Shell 3 .28.4 GNOME Shell Extensions \u00b6 GNOME Shell Extensions are small pieces of code written by third party developers that modify the way GNOME works. They are similar to Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons. We can install the extensions via extensions.gnome.org in Firefox. After installation, we can disable or enable, or even configure on such website, alternatively, we can use gnome-tweaks to control them. Lunar Date \u00b6 Here is a plugin to show Chinese Lunar Date: Lunar Calendar \u519c\u5386 . Since here are some latest comments, I guess it would be OK. However, the first installation attempt failed, it shows ERROR . Then I realized that I might need to install the dependency mentioned in the plugin page, sudo apt install gir1.2-lunar-date-2.0 Then reinstall the plugin, it succeed! But interestingly, the Chinese characters are shown as Pinyin (see the following left image) Before After Then I found the same issue in an older post A solution is @GuanGGuanG copy /usr/share/locale/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/liblunar.mo to /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/ \u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6b63\u5e38\u663e\u793a\u4e86 Although no found liblunar.mo , there is $ pwd /usr/share/locale/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES $ ll | grep lunar -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4746 Nov 12 2016 lunar-date.mo then $ sudo cp lunar-date.mo ../../en/LC_MESSAGES/ It cannot take effects immediately, the natural way is to reboot. But currently I do not want to reboot, and then I tried to reinstall the plugin in Firefox, but not work. Then I tried to reload locale since the modification seems related to locale, so I found this answer and tried $ . /etc/default/locale but not work. Then I realized that it might be necessary to reload GNOME Shell, so I found How to restart GNOME Shell from command line? , and tried $ gnome-shell --replace & It works, as shown in the above right figure. A minor side change is that the English colon in the time 14:37 seems to change to the Chinese colon.

to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded ; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available. dist-upgrade dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages ; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.

to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded ; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available. dist-upgrade dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages ; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences ( 5 ) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages. \u4f46\u662f\u7adf\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230 full-upgrade .

However, I note that the version has been updated, although it is still for Ubuntu 18.04, not Ubuntu 16.04. Same results with the previous try, cannot start it after installing it, and no error thrown in the install procedure. But today I went further, I found that after I type /opt/baidunetdisk/baidunetdisk it throws an error, This program requires version 3.3.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.6.1. Try to install latest version from protocolbuffers/protobuf , first time the latest one, 3.14, but it doesn\u2019t work and it require .so.9 , while v3.14 has a .so.22 , I also tried copy .so.22 to .so.9 , or make a soft link, doesn\u2019t work. The second time I install v3.3 , the .so.[NUM] still does not match, and hence doesn\u2019t work. The error is libmirprotobuf.so.3: undefined symbol: _ZNK6google8protobuf11MessageLite25InitializationErrorStringB5cxx11Ev and then I follow the instructions in Ubuntu: mir package sudo apt-get purge libprotobuf-lite9v5 sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-lite9v5 the first step throws the dependencies warnings, related to libqt5 , then I uninstall libqt5 . Unfortunately, many running programs then exit when the uninstalling procedure keeps going, and I found that I make a big mistake!! Now, maybe the best way is to update my system from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 to recover the broken system. Actually I have updated my old PC from 16.04 to 18.04, seems quite fluent. However, for this PC, there are many disappointing problem. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt autoremove it is necessary to modify /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades from never to lts , otherwise it cannot detect new release version. Then run sudo do -release-upgrade refer to \u5c06 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \u5347\u7ea7\u5230 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Due to previous HK Ubuntu mirror, the speed is quite slow, then the first thing I need to do is to replace the mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list with aliyun by sed operation via sudo sed -i \"s#http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux/ubuntu/#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/#\" sources.list \u540e\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u81f3\uff0c sudo sed -i \"s#ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux#archive.ubuntu.com#g\" sources.list Then go on. However, I mistook enter something in the middle, and stop the installation procedure, that is might be part of the reason why I met so many problems. Try to run do-release-upgrade again, but it said no new release version, and told me to upgrade the software in the current version. Actually it is Ubuntu 18.04 now, checking by lsb_release -a then I run sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade after the first run, I think I am OK. But in the rebooting, I cannot enter into the system, the Ubuntu logo is twinkling, and sometimes I can switch to the command window, it holds with message a start job is running for hold until boot process finishes up\uff08X s/unlimit\uff09 but do not want to try the re-install solution in \u95ee\u98981\uff1aa start job is running for hold until boot process finishes up\uff08X s/unlimit\uff09 , because I guess my situation would be quite different, since I uninstall libqt5 , and interrupt the normal release updating procedure, Then I found some other possible solutions, sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop sudo apt-get install unity But the first thing I need to do is to stop it by power, and then choose to start an advanced session in the grub session, and I chose a recovery mode , then I entered into a command line. And I can continue to fix the problem. But before I can install the desktop , repeat to run update and upgrade , then updating texlive from 2015 to 2017 throws an error, dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/texlive-fonts-extra-doc_2017.20180305-2_all.deb (\u2013unpack): trying to overwrite \u2018/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/mweights/README\u2019, which is also in package texlive-latex-extra-doc 2015.20160320-1 dpkg-deb: error: paste subprocess was killed by signal (Broken pipe) try install -f , but does not work, the solution is sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/texlive-fonts-extra-doc_2017.20180305-2_all.deb refer to \u5728apt\u66f4\u65b0texlive\u52302017\u7684\u95ee\u9898 then I reboot to test, but the internet broken, ifconfig only returns lo , but ifconfig -a shows all possible cards, I have tried service restart like in UBUNTU ifconfig\u53ea\u6709lo , but it does not work, then I found the solution worked for me sudo dhclient enp** in Ubuntu\u8f93\u5165ifconfig\u627e\u4e0d\u5230IP\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u53ea\u6709lo\u95ee\u9898 .

2020-04-12 I want to install BaiduYunpan for Linux, but actually I have tried it before, which cannot work for my current version. However, I note that the version has been updated, although it is still for Ubuntu 18.04, not Ubuntu 16.04. Same results with the previous try, cannot start it after installing it, and no error thrown in the install procedure. But today I went further, I found that after I type /opt/baidunetdisk/baidunetdisk it throws an error, This program requires version 3.3.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.6.1. Try to install latest version from protocolbuffers/protobuf , first time the latest one, 3.14, but it doesn\u2019t work and it require .so.9 , while v3.14 has a .so.22 , I also tried copy .so.22 to .so.9 , or make a soft link, doesn\u2019t work. The second time I install v3.3 , the .so.[NUM] still does not match, and hence doesn\u2019t work. The error is libmirprotobuf.so.3: undefined symbol: _ZNK6google8protobuf11MessageLite25InitializationErrorStringB5cxx11Ev and then I follow the instructions in Ubuntu: mir package sudo apt-get purge libprotobuf-lite9v5 sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-lite9v5 the first step throws the dependencies warnings, related to libqt5 , then I uninstall libqt5 . Unfortunately, many running programs then exit when the uninstalling procedure keeps going, and I found that I make a big mistake!! Now, maybe the best way is to update my system from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 to recover the broken system. Actually I have updated my old PC from 16.04 to 18.04, seems quite fluent. However, for this PC, there are many disappointing problem. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt autoremove it is necessary to modify /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades from never to lts , otherwise it cannot detect new release version. Then run sudo do -release-upgrade refer to \u5c06 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \u5347\u7ea7\u5230 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Due to previous HK Ubuntu mirror, the speed is quite slow, then the first thing I need to do is to replace the mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list with aliyun by sed operation via sudo sed -i \"s#http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux/ubuntu/#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu/#\" sources.list \u540e\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u81f3\uff0c sudo sed -i \"s#ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux#archive.ubuntu.com#g\" sources.list Then go on. However, I mistook enter something in the middle, and stop the installation procedure, that is might be part of the reason why I met so many problems. Try to run do-release-upgrade again, but it said no new release version, and told me to upgrade the software in the current version. Actually it is Ubuntu 18.04 now, checking by lsb_release -a then I run sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade after the first run, I think I am OK. But in the rebooting, I cannot enter into the system, the Ubuntu logo is twinkling, and sometimes I can switch to the command window, it holds with message a start job is running for hold until boot process finishes up\uff08X s/unlimit\uff09 but do not want to try the re-install solution in \u95ee\u98981\uff1aa start job is running for hold until boot process finishes up\uff08X s/unlimit\uff09 , because I guess my situation would be quite different, since I uninstall libqt5 , and interrupt the normal release updating procedure, Then I found some other possible solutions, sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop sudo apt-get install unity But the first thing I need to do is to stop it by power, and then choose to start an advanced session in the grub session, and I chose a recovery mode , then I entered into a command line. And I can continue to fix the problem. But before I can install the desktop , repeat to run update and upgrade , then updating texlive from 2015 to 2017 throws an error, dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/texlive-fonts-extra-doc_2017.20180305-2_all.deb (\u2013unpack): trying to overwrite \u2018/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/mweights/README\u2019, which is also in package texlive-latex-extra-doc 2015.20160320-1 dpkg-deb: error: paste subprocess was killed by signal (Broken pipe) try install -f , but does not work, the solution is sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/texlive-fonts-extra-doc_2017.20180305-2_all.deb refer to \u5728apt\u66f4\u65b0texlive\u52302017\u7684\u95ee\u9898 then I reboot to test, but the internet broken, ifconfig only returns lo , but ifconfig -a shows all possible cards, I have tried service restart like in UBUNTU ifconfig\u53ea\u6709lo , but it does not work, then I found the solution worked for me sudo dhclient enp** in Ubuntu\u8f93\u5165ifconfig\u627e\u4e0d\u5230IP\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u53ea\u6709lo\u95ee\u9898 .

With scientific = TRUE option, nsmall would fail, p ( format ( signif ( x , digits = 3 ), scientific = T , nsmall = 3 + floor ( - log10 ( x )))) # format(signif(x, digits = 3), scientific = T, nsmall = 3 + floor(-log10(x))) = 4.9e-02 as the manual ?format said, the minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point in formatting real/complex numbers in non-scientific formats .

Then I change to a different R version with cairo support, and it can work without -X option. And the setting in .Rprofile can also been removed (or actually the default is exactly the same).

Then I change to a different R version with cairo support, and it can work without -X option. And the setting in .Rprofile can also been removed (or actually the default is exactly the same).

Tweak NAMESPACE imports. but actually the last version is back to March 2018, which is already prior to Wenyu\u2019s sister. Anyway, we have tried to install the old version package, and try to see whether there are some differences. The command for installing a specified version would be install.packages ( \"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/tree/tree_1.0-39.tar.gz\" , repos = NULL , type = \"source\" ) in the R console. However, at the beginning, I am not familiar with it. So I use the interface of rstudio to manually install the old tree \u2018s. Finally, I had tried v1.0-28 , v1.0-33 , v1.0-37 and v1.0-39 , but all of them yield the same results as the latest version. R version \u00b6 Currently, we are using the latest R version, v3.6.0 . Firstly, I had tried the old version v3.4.4 on my server rstudio. It can successfully reproduce the results of the book. Now our goal is to determine the version from which we fail to obtain the same results. It requires us to install multiple R versions to test the above program. The docker facilitates the multiple R versions easily. Here is an official images for r-base , including most old versions of R. We can install a specified R version with the following commands by tagging the version number, docker pull r-base:3.6.0 docker run -it --rm r-base:3.6.0 As a result, v3.5.3 (the largest version of v3.5.x ) can reproduce the results, while it failed in the R version from v3.6.0 . Then I found the changelog for v3.6.0 . The first point is exactly what we want, Changes to random number generation. R 3.6.0 changes the method used to generate random integers in the sample function. In prior versions, the probability of generating each integer could vary from equal by up to 0.04% (or possibly more if generating more than a million different integers). This change will mainly be relevant to people who do large-scale simulations, and it also means that scripts using the sample function will generate different results in R 3.6.0 than they did in prior versions of R. If you need to keep the results the same (for reproducibility or for automated testing), you can revert to the old behavior by adding RNGkind(sample.kind=\"Rounding\") ) to the top of your script. In a word, for the R starting from v3.6.0 , we can add RNGkind ( sample.kind = \"Rounding\" ) to reproduce the results that did in prior versions of R.","title":"new sample function (v3.6.0+)"},{"location":"R/sample/#sample-function-in-r-360","text":"Wenyu found a very interesting question about R programming. When he was preparing his tutorial, he cannot reproduce the code in the section 8.3 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R (ISLR) , but his sister can successfully produce the results last year.

Also, it can be exported to either biblatex or bibtex . With biblatex , do not care about the accented characters, just use its original format With bibtex , it will automatically convert the accented characters with necessary backslashes. The original abstract field is, Karhunen\u2013Lo`{e}ve decomposition after exporting to .bib file, it becomes Karhunen\u2013Lo{\\textbackslash}`{e}ve decomposition and it throws an error when compiling, ! File ended while scanning use of \\field. My first solution is to check if there are some setting when exporting to .bib file to drop some field, such as abstract here, but finally I failed to find one, and here is a discussion in the Zotero community. Then I try to replace `{e} with {`e} in the Zotero\u2019s abstract field as said in How to write \u201c\u00e4\u201d and other umlauts and accented letters in bibliography? , which also list several accented characters, {\"a} {\\^e} {`i} {.I} {\\o} {'u} {\\aa} {\\c c} {\\u g} {\\l} {~n} {\\H o} {\\v r} {\\ss} {\\r u} but it still doesnt work. Finally, I directly correct the exported file using the above technique, and it works. But I still think it is not a good idea since I prefer to export without any further modifications.

Change section title without altering the cleveref cross-referencing system \u00b6 Info Contributed by ZexiCAI on 2021-09-06. Suppose you want the section title to be \u201cGood Title 1\u201d, \u201cGood Title 2\u201d, etc., and you want cross-reference two sections at the same time as \u201cGood Titles 1 and 2\u201d instead of \u201cGood Title 1 and Good Title 2\u201d. Although one can do it mannually, the author is lazy and would like the cross-referencing system to do it automatically. The simplest way to do (1) is to change the \\thesection definition: \\renewcommand { \\thesection }{ Good Title \\arabic { section }} However, when you do cross-referencing (\u201ccref\u201d or \u201cCref\u201d), it will appear to be \u201csection Good Title 1\u201d and \u201csection Good Title 2\u201d. A feasible way to do it is to directly modify the definition of \\section command. Its original definition is \\newcommand\\section { \\@ startsection { section }{ 1 }{ \\z @ } % { -3.5ex \\@ plus -1ex \\@ minus -.2ex } % { 2.3ex \\@ plus.2ex } % { \\normalfont\\Large\\bfseries }} We can modify it as \\renewcommand\\section { \\@ startsection { section }{ 1 }{ \\z @ } % { -3.5ex \\@ plus -1ex \\@ minus -.2ex } % { 2.3ex \\@ plus.2ex } % { \\normalfont\\Large\\bfseries\\noindent Good Title~ }} This solves (1). To solve (2), we need to change the name of section when calling \u201ccref\u201d or \u201cCref\u201d, by doing \\crefname { section }{ Good Title }{ Good Titles } \\Crefname { section }{ Good Title }{ Good Titles } Warning Note that however this will change the name globally.","title":"General"},{"location":"TeX/#tex","text":"Online LaTeX Editor: https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php","title":"\u5173\u4e8e TeX"},{"location":"TeX/#installation-of-texlive","text":"TL;DR Following the official instruction , download install-tl run it, and optionally specify the mirror location for faster download speed","title":"Installation of TeXLive"},{"location":"TeX/#2021-on-rocky","text":"did not click create symlinks to standard directories after running ./install-tl create module file, /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles/texlive/2021 , set version 2021 set app texlive set modroot /usr/local/ $app / $version prepend-path PATH $modroot /bin/x86_64-linux prepend-path MANPATH $modroot /texmf-dist/doc/man prepend-path INFOPATH $modroot /texmf-dist/doc/info then call it after loading the module, $ which pdflatex /usr/bin/pdflatex $ module load texlive/2021 $ which pdflatex /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/pdflatex","title":"2021 on Rocky"},{"location":"TeX/#2017-2020","text":"The TeXLive 2017 for Ubuntu cannot work for me, it reports fatal: Could not undump 6994 4-byte item(s) \u2026 and try fmtutil-sys \u2013all refer to Error Message: \u201ctex: fatal: Could not undump 1 4-byte item(s) from\u201d , but does not work.

Suppose you want the section title to be \u201cGood Title 1\u201d, \u201cGood Title 2\u201d, etc., and you want cross-reference two sections at the same time as \u201cGood Titles 1 and 2\u201d instead of \u201cGood Title 1 and Good Title 2\u201d. Although one can do it mannually, the author is lazy and would like the cross-referencing system to do it automatically. The simplest way to do (1) is to change the \\thesection definition: \\renewcommand { \\thesection }{ Good Title \\arabic { section }} However, when you do cross-referencing (\u201ccref\u201d or \u201cCref\u201d), it will appear to be \u201csection Good Title 1\u201d and \u201csection Good Title 2\u201d. A feasible way to do it is to directly modify the definition of \\section command. Its original definition is \\newcommand\\section { \\@ startsection { section }{ 1 }{ \\z @ } % { -3.5ex \\@ plus -1ex \\@ minus -.2ex } % { 2.3ex \\@ plus.2ex } % { \\normalfont\\Large\\bfseries }} We can modify it as \\renewcommand\\section { \\@ startsection { section }{ 1 }{ \\z @ } % { -3.5ex \\@ plus -1ex \\@ minus -.2ex } % { 2.3ex \\@ plus.2ex } % { \\normalfont\\Large\\bfseries\\noindent Good Title~ }} This solves (1). To solve (2), we need to change the name of section when calling \u201ccref\u201d or \u201cCref\u201d, by doing \\crefname { section }{ Good Title }{ Good Titles } \\Crefname { section }{ Good Title }{ Good Titles } Warning Note that however this will change the name globally.","title":"Change section title without altering the cleveref cross-referencing system"},{"location":"TeX/CI/","text":"XeLaTeX on Travis CI \u00b6 \u53c2\u8003 Setup LaTeX PDF build using Travis CI Document building & versioning with TeX document, Git, Continuous Integration & Dropbox first example \u00b6 no chinese no other packages before_install: - \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-recommended dvipng\" script: - cd proposal - xelatex test It turns out that no xelatex. second example \u00b6 before_install: - \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-xetex dvipng\" script: - cd proposal - xelatex test succeed! install Chinese fonts \u00b6 sudo: required dist: trusty before_install: - \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-xetex dvipng\" - \"wget -c https://sourceforge.net/projects/zjuthesis/files/fonts.tar.gz/download && tar xzf fonts.tar.gz && sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/custom/ && mv fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/truetype/custom/ && sudo fc-cache -f -v\" script: - cd proposal - xelatex test wrong error in wget.

R \u00b6 r-base \u00b6 The images are hosted on Docker Official Images: r-base . Without pulling, docker pull r-base:4.1.0 we can directly run the following code, docker run -it r-base:4.1.0 then the R session would appear. We can install packages as usual, such as > install.packages ( \"dplyr\" ) but note that the modification would discard after quitting. So it is necessary to save the changes (refer to How to Commit Changes to a Docker Image with Examples ) via $ docker commit container-ID new-image-name Next time, we can run with the installed packages, $ docker run -it new-image-name If we want to plot, then it is necessary to forward X11, see Alternatives to ssh X11-forwarding for Docker containers for more details. Or as @edd suggested in Enable plotting for r-base container via X-Forwarding , a better one might be to use a container with RStudio Server. XAMPP \u00b6 XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform (X) web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server (A) , MariaDB database (M) (formerly MySQL), and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP (P) and Perl (P) programming languages. Info My DaSS Project Here is a great docker image ! Start via #$ docker pull tomsik68/xampp $ docker run --name myXAMPP -p 41061 :22 -p 41062 :80 -d -v ~/my_web_pages:/www tomsik68/xampp:8 Tip docker run and docker container run are exactly the same since docker run will automatically download the image if no installed, then docker pull is unnecessary. -v /HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR creates a bind mount. -p hostPort:containerPort publishes the container\u2019s port to the host. -d runs the container in the background and print the new container ID. More details can be checked via man docker-run .

We use it to create a \u201cfeeder\u201d task for each process. Each task picks the next index that needs to be computed, then waits for its process to finish, then repeats until we run out of indices. Note that the feeder tasks do not begin to execute until the main task reaches the end of the @sync block, at which point it surrenders control and waits for all the local tasks to complete before returning from the function. Info Applications in my project: parallel.job , where it is much like the feeder, although it might be quite fast.

If I have the sudo privilege, maybe just type sudo apt-get install qt5-default but I cannot. But I noticed that I have installed miniconda3 , and the qt is installed, qmake -v # QMake version 3.1 # Using Qt version 5.9.7 in /users/xxx/miniconda3/lib So a natural way is to append the library path of qt to LD_LIBRARY_PATH , that is, # in .bashrc export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /users/xxx/miniconda3/lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH then rebuild GR package in the julia REPL. This solution should work, but actually it failed at the first time. Do not be too frustrated, I found the reason is that I type miniconda3 as minconda3 in the path. It works now, although it still throw an error, julia > libGL error : unable to load driver : swrast_dri . so libGL error : failed to load driver : swrast reset kw... value \u00b6 In the following situation, I want to reset a particular argument in kw... . function f (; kw ... ) g (; kw ... ) end Note that the type of kw is Base.Iterators.Pairs , firstly I want to directly reset the value via h (; kw ... ) = kw h ( a = 1 ) . data . a = 2 but it throws ERROR: setfield! immutable struct of type NamedTuple cannot be changed Stacktrace: [1] setproperty!(::NamedTuple{(:a,),Tuple{Int64}}, ::Symbol, ::Int64) at ./Base.jl:21 [2] top-level scope at none:0 So I need to find new method, or give up such idea. Fortunately, the official documentation of Julia says The nature of keyword arguments makes it possible to specify the same argument more than once. For example, in the call plot(x, y; options..., width=2) it is possible that the options structure also contains a value for width . Thus, I can write function f (; kw ... ) g (; kw ... , b = 6 ) end to solve my problem, where b is the argument I want to reset. some interesting behavior \u00b6 d = Dict { Int , Int }() d [ 1 ] = 1 if we access d . vals # d.keys it will return a 16-element Array{Int64,1} , but if we use values ( d ) keys ( d ) it correctly returns the exactly one elements, but with type Base.ValueIterator for a Dict{Int64,Int64} with 1 entry . pass array into function \u00b6 julia > a = [ 1 , 2 ] 2 - element Array { Int64 , 1 } : 1 2 julia > function f ( a ) a = a .+ 1 end f ( generic function with 1 method ) julia > f ( a ) 2 - element Array { Int64 , 1 } : 2 3 julia > a 2 - element Array { Int64 , 1 } : 1 2 julia > function g ( a ) a .= a .+ 1 end g ( generic function with 1 method ) julia > g ( a ) 2 - element Array { Int64 , 1 } : 2 3 julia > a 2 - element Array { Int64 , 1 } : 2 3 check whether array entry is undef \u00b6 b = Array { Array { Int , 1 }}( undef , 3 ) isdefined ( b , 1 ) # or isassigned ( b , 1 ) # not # isdefined(b[1]) refer to Julia: check whether array entry is undef Memory Allocation \u00b6 Usage of GC.gc() \u00b6 Manually run GC.gc() can release the occupied memory, The experiments are as follows, open a julia1.6 session run tseries = zeros(1024,1024, 5, 50); , it allocates 1.953GB, roughtly 1.953/16 = 12% , while the column MEM% displayed by htop indeed show 11.4 . repeat to run, then MEM% increses to 21.5 run GC.gc() , then MEM% decreases to 11.0 repeat to run 2 times, then MEM% increases to 31.2 run GC.gc() , then MEM% decreases to 11.0 set tseries = nothing , and run GC.gc() , it disappears from the top line of htop , i.e., (nearly) zero memory. Refer to the following video for the whole experiments. Another experiments are for for loop, julia > for i = 1 : 6 tseries = zeros ( 1024 , 1024 , 5 , 50 ); sleep ( 3 ) if i % 3 == 0 println ( \"gc...\" ) GC . gc (); sleep ( 3 ) end end It can be observed that MEM% increses from ~10 to ~20, and then ~30, then decreases to ~10 after first GC. With monitoring the memory from top , we can use the following memuse() function to get the memory usage of the current process. function memuse () pid = getpid () return round ( Int , parse ( Int , read ( `ps -p $pid -o rss=` , String )) / 1024 ) end println ( \"init mem = \" , memuse (), \"MB\" ) for i = 1 : 6 # tseries = zeros(1024,1024, 5, 50); r = R \"rnorm(1024*1024*5*50)\" # sleep(3) println ( \"i = \" , i , \", mem = \" , memuse (), \"MB\" ) if i % 3 == 0 finalize ( r ) GC . gc (); GC . gc (); GC . gc (); GC . gc (); R \"gc()\" ; R \"gc()\" ; sleep ( 3 ) println ( \"after gc..., mem = \" , memuse (), \"MB\" ) end end function test () for i = 1 : 2 println ( \" \\n i= $i \" ) a = rand ( 10000 , 10000 ) println ( \"Created a $ ( memuse ()) \" ) a = 0 GC . gc () println ( \"Release a $ ( memuse ()) \\n \" ) b = rand ( 10000 , 10000 ) println ( \"Created b $ ( memuse ()) \" ) b = 0 GC . gc () println ( \"Release b $ ( memuse ()) \\n \" ) c = rand ( 10000 , 10000 ) println ( \"Created c $ ( memuse ()) \" ) c = 0 GC . gc () println ( \"Release c $ ( memuse ()) \\n \" ) end end See also: Running GC.gc() multiple times Understanding when GC.gc() frees memory and doesn\u2019t Note The most possible reason for abnormally increasing memory is due to memory leak instead of insufficient gc() .

I begin with the example code in the README, gui = imshow_gui (( 300 , 300 ), ( 2 , 1 )) # 2 columns, 1 row of images (each initially 300\u00d7300) canvases = gui [ \"canvas\" ] imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 1 ], testimage ( \"lighthouse\" )) imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 2 ], testimage ( \"mandrill\" )) Gtk . showall ( gui [ \"window\" ]) it throws an error when accessing canvases[1,2] julia > imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 2 ], testimage ( \"mandrill\" )) ERROR : BoundsError : attempt to access 2 \u00d7 1 Array { Any , 2 } at index [ 1 , 2 ] and I check the size of canvases is julia > size ( canvases ) ( 2 , 1 ) it seems that the canvases will arrage by column while the gui declares it should be by rows. On the other hand, if I run gui = imshow_gui (( 300 , 300 ), ( 2 , 1 )) # 2 columns, 1 row of images (each initially 300\u00d7300) canvases = gui [ \"canvas\" ] imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 1 ], testimage ( \"lighthouse\" )) imshow ( canvases [ 2 , 1 ], testimage ( \"mandrill\" )) Gtk . showall ( gui [ \"window\" ]) gui = imshow_gui (( 300 , 300 ), ( 1 , 2 )) # 2 columns, 1 row of images (each initially 300\u00d7300) canvases = gui [ \"canvas\" ] imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 1 ], testimage ( \"lighthouse\" )) imshow ( canvases [ 1 , 2 ], testimage ( \"mandrill\" )) Gtk . showall ( gui [ \"window\" ]) Then I guess it might due to the version of some packages\u2026 \u540c\u65f6\u5b89\u88c5\u591a\u4e2a package \u00b6 \u7528\u7a7a\u683c\u9694\u5f00\uff0c\u5982 add Distributions Combinatorics MATLAB PyPlot LightGraphsFlows LightGraphs Clp Plots \u5185\u5730\u955c\u50cf\u6e90 \u00b6 \u5b89\u88c5 PkgMirrors \uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e2d\u79d1\u5927\u6216\u8005\u6d59\u5927\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u6e90\u4e86 \u521d\u6b21\u8bbe\u7f6e\u540e\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u76f4\u63a5 using PkgMirrors \u4fbf\u5207\u6362\u5230\u8bbe\u7f6e\u597d\u7684\u955c\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u955c\u50cf\u6e90\u5b89\u88c5\u3002 select text in the output pdf \u00b6 Several weeks ago, the text, such as the label, title or legend, in the output pdf via savefig(\"xxx.pdf\") can be selected, but recently I found that I cannot select the text in the pdf. The reason would be the version of the packages. I had tried GRUtils , and GRUtils.savefig can output pdf to select the texts, so I think the reason is some changes in Plots package. And I found that with Plots@0.27.0 in Julia1.0 , I can select the text, but currently the newer Plots@1.2.0 cannot produce such pdf. To determine the change, maybe I need more effort to try different versions. But now I can downgrade the version to satisfy my requirement. colorviews for images \u00b6 check the help document by ?colorviews , and there are some examples to illustrate its usage, but here I add some examples that I used in my projects. julia > colorview ( RGB , rand ( 3 , 10 , 10 )) 10 \u00d7 10 reshape ( reinterpret ( RGB { Float64 }, :: Array { Float64 , 3 }), 10 , 10 ) with eltype RGB { Float64 } : and we need to permutate the dims such that the first dim matches with RGB. julia > colorview ( RGB , permutedims ( rand ( 10 , 10 , 3 ), ( 3 , 1 , 2 ))) 10 \u00d7 10 reshape ( reinterpret ( RGB { Float64 }, :: Array { Float64 , 3 }), 10 , 10 ) with eltype RGB { Float64 } : we also can append the alpha channel to an image, such as julia > colorview ( RGBA , colorview ( RGB , rand ( 3 , 10 , 10 )), rand ( 10 , 10 )) 10 \u00d7 10 mappedarray ( RGBA { Float64 }, ImageCore . extractchannels , reshape ( reinterpret ( RGB { Float64 }, :: Array { Float64 , 3 }), 10 , 10 ), :: Array { Float64 , 2 }) with eltype RGBA { Float64 } : but directly append the array does not work, julia > colorview ( RGBA , rand ( 3 , 10 , 10 ), rand ( 10 , 10 )) ERROR : DimensionMismatch ( \"arrays do not all have the same axes (got (Base.OneTo(3), Base.OneTo(10), Base.OneTo(10)) and (Base.OneTo(10), Base.OneTo(10)))\" ) which should be replaced with julia > colorview ( RGBA , rand ( 4 , 10 , 10 )) 10 \u00d7 10 reshape ( reinterpret ( RGBA { Float64 }, :: Array { Float64 , 3 }), 10 , 10 ) with eltype RGBA { Float64 } : To use RGB{N0f8} , the input array should be UInt8 not Int , julia > colorview ( RGB { N0f8 }, Array { UInt8 }( fill ( 1 , 3 , 10 , 10 ))) 10 \u00d7 10 reshape ( reinterpret ( RGB { N0f8 }, view ( :: Array { UInt8 , 3 }, [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], : , : )), 10 , 10 ) with eltype RGB { Normed { UInt8 , 8 }} : return values of function \u00b6 julia > versioninfo () Julia Version 1.4.0 Commit b8e9a9ecc6 ( 2020 - 03 - 21 16 : 36 UTC ) Platform Info : OS : Linux ( x86_64 - pc - linux - gnu ) CPU : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) i5 - 6300 HQ CPU @ 2.30 GHz WORD_SIZE : 64 LIBM : libopenlibm LLVM : libLLVM - 8.0.1 ( ORCJIT , skylake ) julia > function f ( a , b , c , d ) return a , b , c , d end julia > a = f ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ); julia > a ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) julia > a , b = f ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ); julia > a 1 julia > b 2 julia > a , b , c = f ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ); julia > a 1 julia > b 2 julia > c 3 String \u00b6 padding zero on the left \u00b6 For example, convert \u201c1\u201d to \u201c001\u201d, Julia Python julia > lpad ( 1 , 3 , '0' ) \"001\" >>> a = 1 >>> f \" { a : 03 } \" '001' check if substring \u00b6 Julia Python julia > occursin ( \"tech\" , \"techNotes\" ) true >>> \"tech\" in \"techNotes\" True single/double quoting \u00b6 julia > a = ' www ' ERROR : syntax : invalid character literal julia > a = 'w' 'w' : ASCII / Unicode U + 0077 ( category Ll : Letter , lowercase ) julia > a = \"ww\" \"ww\" refer to #105 . run command line \u00b6 For example, to combine different figures, run ( `convert p1.png p2.png +append p12.png` ) but if there are two many figures to combine, the correct way is to keep the multiple figure name as an array, figs = \"p\" .* string .

If I have the sudo privilege, maybe just type sudo apt-get install qt5-default but I cannot. But I noticed that I have installed miniconda3 , and the qt is installed, qmake -v # QMake version 3.1 # Using Qt version 5.9.7 in /users/xxx/miniconda3/lib So a natural way is to append the library path of qt to LD_LIBRARY_PATH , that is, # in .bashrc export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /users/xxx/miniconda3/lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH then rebuild GR package in the julia REPL. This solution should work, but actually it failed at the first time. Do not be too frustrated, I found the reason is that I type miniconda3 as minconda3 in the path.

In python 3.x, all classes are new style - no need to set the metaclass. refer to class ClassName versus class ClassName(object) __getitem__ and __setitem__ \u00b6 I came across the usage of __getitem__ here , which seems powerful, and not only accept T [ x , y ] also supports T [[ x , y ]] in my code , where T is an instance of a class and [x, y] is the coordinate. The [] is enabled due to the __getitem__ method. class TildCoder (): def __init ( ... ): ... def __getitem__ ( self , x ): ... Then I found more detailed explanation for the usage. The [] syntax for getting item by key or index is just syntax sugar.

By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations. The only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries.

with the IPython notebook. !ls simply calls system\u2019s ls , but !!ls also returns the result formatted as a list, which is equivalent to %sx ls . %sx : shell execute, run shell command and capture output, and !! is short-hand. remote ipython kernel \u00b6 \u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u73a9 jupyter \u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b ipython kernel

Thus, if the first argument is 0, then the inserted path would be firstly searched, otherwise, it would be inserted after the first path, the current folder. refer to First argument of sys.path.insert in python TensorFlow \u00b6 the i -th row in pandas \u00b6 df_test . iloc [ 0 ] key in sorted \u00b6 As said in Key Functions \u2013 Sorting HOW TO , the key function is to specify a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons. sorted ( \"This is a test string from Andrew\" . split (), key = str . lower ) and met such technique in 4ment/marginal-experiments unittest and coverage \u00b6 candidate packages Coverage.py coveralls-python the schematic of unittest framework in python: Running unittest with typical test directory structure run locally \u00b6 write unittest scripts in folder test install coveralls-python : conda install coveralls obtain the COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN from coveralls run the script file run_local_coverall.sh #!/bin/bash cd test/ coverage run test_script.py mv .coverage .. cd ..

An alternative is to use perl , $ printf \"###BEGIN-EXCLUDE\\nwww\\n###END-EXCLUDE\" | perl -0777 -pe \"s/###BEGIN-EXCLUDE(.*?)###END-EXCLUDE/xxx/igs\" xxx where -0777 causes Perl to slurp files whole, see -0[octal/hexadecimal] for more details -e commandline -p : my understanding is something for printing, but the official document explain more For a file to be edited in-place, we add -i , $ perl -0777 -i -pe \"s/###BEGIN-EXCLUDE(.*?)###END-EXCLUDE//igs\" test.txt if we supply an extension such as -i'.orig' , then the old file would be backed up to test.txt.orig . Refer to How can I use sed to replace a multi-line string? Moreover, .*? is a non-greedy match, comparing to .* . $ echo \"s12tAs34t\" | perl -pe \"s/s(.*?)t/xx/igs\" xxAxx $ echo \"s12tAs34t\" | perl -pe \"s/s(.*)t/xx/igs\" xx Refer to 6.15. Greedy and Non-Greedy Matches docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch06_16.htm for details. By default, grep performs greedy match, adding option -P would enable Perl\u2019s non-greedy match. Info An real application: update_bib.sh Refer to How to do a non-greedy match in grep? Cut Lines from Large File \u00b6 TL; DR the most efficient is tail -n+ | head (or head | tail ) the exit option q for sed , exit for awk and perl can speed up. prepare the follow text file to compare the processing speed of several common methods, $ l1 = 1000000 $ l2 = 1000050 $ l = 100000000 $ seq 1e8 > test.txt head + tail $ time tail -n+ $l1 test.txt | head -n $(( $l2 - $l1 + 1 )) > /dev/null real 0m0.033s user 0m0.019s sys 0m0.000s $ time head -n $l2 test.txt | tail -n $(( $l2 - $l1 + 1 )) > /dev/null real 0m0.014s user 0m0.019s sys 0m0.007s $ time tail -n $(( $l - $l1 + 1 )) test.txt | head -n $(( $l2 - $l1 + 1 )) > /dev/null real 0m25.930s user 0m1.467s sys 0m1.807s note that tail -n+ is much powerful than tail -n , it seems like the former one just move the cursor to the specific line, while the latter need to load/count from the last line (my guess). Refer to cat line X to line Y on a huge file sed / awk / perl solutions read the whole file and since this is about huge files, they\u2019re not very efficient. But they can be faster via exit or quit after the last line in the specified range (refer to What\u2019s the best way to take a segment out of a text file? ): sed $ time sed -n \" $l1 , $l2 p\" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m4.621s user 0m4.253s sys 0m0.336s $ time sed -n \" $l1 , $l2 p; $l2 q\" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m0.054s user 0m0.047s sys 0m0.008s awk $ time awk \" $l1 <= NR && NR <= $l2 \" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m15.294s user 0m15.046s sys 0m0.220s $ time awk \" $l1 <= NR && NR <= $l2 ; NR> $l2 {exit}\" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m0.158s user 0m0.158s sys 0m0.001s perl $ time perl -ne \"print if ${ l1 } .. ${ l2 } \" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m10.708s user 0m10.498s sys 0m0.200s $ time perl -ne \"print if $ . >= ${ l1 } ; exit if $ . > ${ l2 } \" test.txt > /dev/null real 0m0.203s user 0m0.203s sys 0m0.000s others $ time ed -s test.txt <<< \" $l1 , $l2 p\" > /dev/null real 0m43.132s user 0m6.234s sys 0m3.637s Delete Lines in Large File \u00b6 either q or u does not make differences for deleting. $ seq 1e7 > test.txt $ time sed -iu \" $l1 , $l2 d\" test.txt real 0m26.481s user 0m5.558s sys 0m20.592s $ time sed -iu \" $l1 , $l2 d; $l2 q\" test.txt real 0m26.560s user 0m5.611s sys 0m20.566s $ time sed -i \" $l1 , $l2 d; $l2 q\" test.txt real 0m27.161s user 0m5.682s sys 0m21.266s $ time { sed \" $l1 , $l2 d\" < test.txt perl -le 'truncate STDOUT, tell STDOUT' } 1 <> test.txt real 0m0.983s user 0m0.913s sys 0m0.069s $ wc -l test.txt 9999949 test.txt Tip \u5728 wc \u4e2d\u6587\u4ef6\u524d\u9762\u63d2\u5165 < \u5219\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u6587\u4ef6\u540d\uff0c\u5373 wc -l < test.txt . \u53e6\u89c1 $ time { head -n \" $(( $l1 - 1 )) \" head -n \" $(( $l2 - $l1 + 1 )) \" > /dev/null cat perl -le 'truncate STDOUT, tell STDOUT' } < test.txt 1 <> test.txt2 real 0m0.069s user 0m0.007s sys 0m0.061s $ wc -l test.txt 10000000 test.txt $ wc -l test.txt2 9999949 test.txt2 where we open two file descriptors to the files, one in read-only mode using < test.txt short for 0< test.txt one in read-write mode using 1<> test.txt2 ( <> file would be 0<> file ) then just treat fd0 as the input and fd1 as the output. the first head reads first $l1 - 1 lines from fd0 and write that to fd1 the second head removes the middle lines from fd0 but fd1 retains. the following cat reads the remaining lines from fd0 to fd1 cat will return when it reaches the end of file on fd0 , but fd1 will point to somewhere in the file that has not been overwritten yet. What we need is to truncate the file at the exact location where that fd1 points to now. That\u2019s done with the ftruncate system call. tell STDOUT gives us the current cursor position associated with fd1 . And we truncate the file at the offset using perl\u2019s interface to the ftruncate system call: truncate . The usage is that truncate FILEHANDLE,LENGTH truncate EXPR,LENGTH Truncates the file opened on FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR, to the specified length. refer to Is there a faster way to remove a line (given a line number) from a file? Warning In the reference, the author wrote < file 1<> file , which might be confusing that he used the same file, then it would throws an error, cat: -: input file is output file Actually, I think he wanted to represent two files comparing to the first solution he mentioned, in which only single file used, and he warned that \u201cDangerous as you\u2019ve no backup copy there.\u201d Here is another discussion on Why can\u2019t an input file be an output file? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange I also run the third solution, but the lines are not deleted. There might be some incompatible reasons. Redirection and File Descriptor \u00b6 hide output from bg process \u00b6 Note that when you put & the output - both stdout and stderr - will still be printed onto the screen. If you do not want to see any output on the screen, redirect both stdout and stderr to a file by: myscript > ~/myscript.log 2 > & 1 & or just myscript > /dev/null 2 > & 1 & refer to Why can I see the output of background processes? Specifically, integer 1 stands for stdout file descriptor, while 2 represents stderr file descriptor (refer to How to redirect stderr to a file ). echo Hello World > /dev/null is same as echo Hello World 1 > /dev/null Info Formally, this is called redirecting output: [n]>[|]word , if n is not specified, it is the standard output (fd 1) . Similarly, redirecting input: [n]<word , if n is not specified, it is the standard input (fd 0) appending redirected output: [n]>>word , if n is not specified, it is the standard output (fd 1) As for spacing , integer is right next to redirection operator, but file can either be next to redirection operator or not, i.e., command 2>/dev/null or command 2> /dev/null . The classical operator, command > file only redirects standard output, several choices to redirect stderr , Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file command > out 2 > error Redirect stdout to a file, and then redirect stderr to stdout NO spacings in 2>&1 command > out 2 > & 1 Redirect both to a file (not supported by all shells, but bash is OK) command & > out Info Formally, this is called redirecting standard output (fd 1) and standard error (fd 2) : &>word or >&word , but the first one is preferred, and it is equivalent to >word 2>&1 . A related one is appending standard output and standard error: &>>word , which is equivalent to >>word 2>&1 In more technical terms , [n]>&word is called Duplicating Output File Descriptor : [n]<&word is used to duplicate input file descriptors. If word expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n is made to be a copy of that file descriptor. [n]>&word is used to duplicate output file descriptors. Warning The order of redirections is significant. For example, ls 2 > & 1 > dirlist directs only the standard output to file dirlist , because the standard error was made a copy of the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist . We can redirect output to a file and stdout simultaneously program [ arguments... ] 2 > & 1 | tee outfile Other kinds of redirections can be found in the official documentation, 3.6 Redirections here documents [ n ] << [ - ] word here-document delimiter for example, HELP_USAGE here strings: [n]<<< word moving file descriptors: [n]<&digit- (or [n]>&digit- ) moves the fd digit to fd n opening fd for reading and writing: [n]<>word , the default is fd 0 if n is not specified. select lines based on 2nd file \u00b6 Given an input file, a b b c c c d e f f g and given the duplicated index file, where the second column is the starting index for duplicates, and the first column is the corresponding number of duplicates. The goal is to delete the duplicated records but only keep one of them. Although $ uniq input.txt can finish the work. But if there are multiple columns in input.txt and the uniqueness is determined by several selected index. It might be convenient to keep the duplicated index (or the corresponding unique index). { lastid = 0 lastn = 1 while read n id ; do echo $n , $id > & 2 retain = $(( $id - ( $lastid + $lastn - 1 ) )) remove = $(( $n - 1 )) echo \" $n , $id , retain $retain , remove $remove \" > & 2 head -n \" $retain \" < & 3 > & 1 # head -n $(($id - 1)) head -n \" $remove \" < & 3 > /dev/null lastn = $n lastid = $id done < duplicated.idx # DO USE `3<` here, otherwise while read from input.txt cat < & 3 > & 1 perl -le 'truncate STDOUT, tell STDOUT' } 3 < input.txt 1 <> out.txt refer to Is there a faster way to remove a line (given a line number) from a file? 3.6 Redirections && vs ; \u00b6 cmd1 && cmd2 : if cmd1 failed, then cmd2 would not execute cmd1 ; cmd2 : if cmd1 failed, cmd2 will still execute so use && when cmd1 is to enter the folder, refer to Crontab - Run in directory - Stack Overflow","title":"Shell Scripts"},{"location":"shell/#shell-scripts","text":"\u6559\u7a0b\u53c2\u8003 \u83dc\u9e1f\u6559\u7a0b GNU Bash Reference Manual","title":"Shell Scripts"},{"location":"shell/#special-parameters","text":"$? : \u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b58\u521a\u521a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8fd4\u56de\u503c 0: \u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\uff1b 1-255: \u8868\u793a\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25 2: All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments. 126: If a command is found but is not executable, the return status 127: If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns 128+N: When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is N, Bash uses the value 128+N as the exit status. refer to GNU Bash manual: 3.7.5 Exit Status for more details. $* , $@ : \u5f15\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u3002Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. $# : \u4f4d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e2a\u6570 $0 : \u811a\u672c\u540d\u79f0 $! : the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background $$ : the process ID of the shell refer to GNU Bash manual: 3.4.2 Special Parameters","title":"Special Parameters"},{"location":"shell/#safer-bash-script","text":"Came across some scripts jperkel/nature_bash start with set -euo pipefail or docker-wechat/dochat.sh set -eo pipefail both of which provide safeguards. -e : cause a bash script to exit immediately when a command fails -o pipefail : set the exit code of a pipeline to that of the rightmost command to exit with a non-zero status, or to zero if all commands of the pipeline exit successfully. -u : treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately refer to Safer bash scripts with \u2018set -euxo pipefail\u2019 \u89e3\u91cabash\u811a\u672c\u4e2dset -e\u4e0eset -o pipefail\u7684\u4f5c\u7528","title":"Safer bash script"},{"location":"shell/#line-begin-with","text":"came across in R_HOME/etc/ldpaths when I am investigating the loading issue of conda env from rstudio, https://github.com/szcf-weiya/techNotes/issues/32#issuecomment-881508987 if test -n \"/media/weiya/PSSD/Programs/anaconda3/envs/R4.1.0/lib\" ; then : ${ R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ${ R_HOME } /lib:/media/weiya/PSSD/Programs/anaconda3/envs/R4.1.0/lib } else : ${ R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ${ R_HOME } /lib } fi I am guessing it is also a grammar for variable assignment, and someone (refer to Colon at the beginning of line in docker entrypoint bash script - Stack Overflow ) has explained that : is a no-op command: that is, it doesn\u2019t do anything, but arguments are evaluated normally.

If the matrix A A is near singular, it is sometimes possible to reduce the condition number and recover a more accurate a more accurate solution vector x x by scaling as (SAS)(S^{-1}x) = Sb (SAS)(S^{-1}x) = Sb where S S is a diagonal matrix whose elements are given by S_{ii}=1/\\sqrt{A_{ii}} S_{ii}=1/\\sqrt{A_{ii}} . This scaling is also known as Jacobi preconditioning . QR \u00b6 A general rectangular M M -by- N N matrix A A has a QR decomposition into the product of an orthogonal M M -by- M M square matrix Q Q , where Q^TQ=I Q^TQ=I , and an M M -by- N N right-triangular matrix R R , A=QR\\,. A=QR\\,. This decomposition can be used to convert the linear system Ax=b Ax=b into the triangular system Rx=Q^Tb Rx=Q^Tb , which can be solved by back-substitution. Another use of the QR decomposition is to compute an orthonormal basis for a set of vectors. The first N N columns of Q Q form an orthonormal basis for the range of A A , ran(A) ran(A) , when A A has full column rank. \\rk(AB) \\leq \\rk(A) \\rk(AB) \\leq \\rk(A) \u00b6 The range of the matrix M M is \\calR(M)=\\{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\R^m \\mid \\mathbf{y}=M\\mathbf{x} \\text{ for some } \\mathbf{x} \\in \\R^n\\}. \\calR(M)=\\{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\R^m \\mid \\mathbf{y}=M\\mathbf{x} \\text{ for some } \\mathbf{x} \\in \\R^n\\}. Recall that the rank of a matrix M M is the dimension of the range R(M) R(M) of the matrix M. So we have \\rk(AB)=\\dim(\\calR(AB)), \\quad \\rk(A)=\\dim(\\calR(A)). \\rk(AB)=\\dim(\\calR(AB)), \\quad \\rk(A)=\\dim(\\calR(A)). In general, if a vector space V V is a subset of a vector space W W , then we have \\dim(V) \\leq \\dim(W). \\dim(V) \\leq \\dim(W). Thus, it suffices to show that the vector space \\calR(AB) \\calR(AB) is a subset of the vector space \\calR(A) \\calR(A) . Consider any vector \\y\\in\\calR(AB) \\y\\in\\calR(AB) . Then there exists a vector \\x\\in\\R^l \\x\\in\\R^l such that \\y=(AB)\\x \\y=(AB)\\x by the definition of the range. Let \\z=B\\x\\in\\R^n \\z=B\\x\\in\\R^n . Then we have \\mathbf{y}=A(B\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{z} \\mathbf{y}=A(B\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{z} and thus the vector \\y \\y is in \\calR(A) \\calR(A) . Thus \\calR(AB) \\calR(AB) is a subset of \\calR(A) \\calR(A) and we have \\rk(AB)=\\dim(\\calR(AB)) \\leq \\dim(\\calR(A))=\\rk(A). \\rk(AB)=\\dim(\\calR(AB)) \\leq \\dim(\\calR(A))=\\rk(A). refer to Rank of the Product of Matrices AB is Less than or Equal to the Rank of A \\rk(A)=\\rk(AA^T)=\\rk(A^TA) \\rk(A)=\\rk(AA^T)=\\rk(A^TA) \u00b6 Note that the left null space (the null space of A^T A^T ) is the orthogonal complement to the column space of A A , that is, \\mathrm{Nul}(A^T)^{\\perp} = \\mathrm{Col}(A), \\quad \\mathrm{Nul}(A)^{\\perp} = \\mathrm{Col}(A^T). \\mathrm{Nul}(A^T)^{\\perp} = \\mathrm{Col}(A), \\quad \\mathrm{Nul}(A)^{\\perp} = \\mathrm{Col}(A^T). Therefore, \\mathrm{Nul}(A^T)\\cap \\mathrm{Col}(A) \\mathrm{Nul}(A^T)\\cap \\mathrm{Col}(A) , and so forth. Now consider the matrix A^TA A^TA . Then \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) = \\{A^TAx\\} = \\{A^Ty:y\\in \\mathrm{Col}(A)\\}. \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) = \\{A^TAx\\} = \\{A^Ty:y\\in \\mathrm{Col}(A)\\}. But since the null space of A^T A^T only intersects trivially with \\mathrm{Col}(A) \\mathrm{Col}(A) , then \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) must have the same dimension as \\mathrm{Col}(A) \\mathrm{Col}(A) , which gives us the equality of ranks.

But since the null space of A^T A^T only intersects trivially with \\mathrm{Col}(A) \\mathrm{Col}(A) , then \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) \\mathrm{Col}(A^TA) must have the same dimension as \\mathrm{Col}(A) \\mathrm{Col}(A) , which gives us the equality of ranks.
