# Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

# For simplicity sake, you may assume:

# words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
# Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
# Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
